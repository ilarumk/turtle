If you have home made sevai or store bought sevai on hand, it is the quickest, easiest and tastiest dish you can ever make. I have already done a post on how to make idiyappam at home using an idiyappam maker\/chakli press. Idiyappam is nothing but rice noodles\/string hoppers\/sevai where rice flour dough is hand pressed using an idiyappam maker and steamed. \r\n\r\nWhenever I make idiyappam, I usually make a large batch so that I can make at least 2 varieties of flavored sevai like lemon sevai, tomato sevai, milagu sevai, vegetable sevai, puli sevai and the likes. Coconut sevai aka thengai sevai is a light tiffin that is high on flavor. Do use roasted cashew nuts as they go very well with this utterly delicious coconut sevai which I consider a gem among easy tiffin recipes. :) \r\n\r\nThengai Sevai\r\n","image":"http:\/\/www.sailusfood.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/07\/thengai-idiyappam.jpg","image-small":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/thengai-idiyappam-150x150.jpg","image-large":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/thengai-idiyappam-300x300.jpg","style":["easy","quick","traditional"],"course":["breakfast"],"special-diet":["eggless","gluten free","dairy free","vegetarian","vegan","kid friendly","pregnancy"],"cuisine":["south indian"],"cook-time":"10","prep-time":"10","main-ingredient":["sevai","coconut"],"serves":"4","author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Indian Breakfast Recipes","Indian Vegan Recipes","Indian Vegetarian Recipes","Lunch Box Recipes","South Indian Recipes"],"tags":["breakfast","rice sevai","tiffins","vegan"]}
