I am talking about the masala murmura which is prepared with chopped onions, tomatoes, chili powder, peanuts, coriander leaves and a dash of lemon juice. Just typing that out made my mouth water. :) I had a huge bag of Muri aka Borugulu\/Marmaralu\/Murmura that needed to be used up and what better than Murmura Chivda. Ridiculously simple to make with minimal ingredients and hardly any cooking time.\r\n\r\nFor those of you who find it challenging to make snacks for your family due to time constraints, Murmura Chivda is the answer. This is a relatively easy and quick snack to put together and not to mention, addictive. Dried coconut, either grated or thin silvers is an essential ingredient along with dalia (roasted chickpeas) and roasted peanuts. I also like to add few cashew nuts since I love them. :)\r\n\r\nSpiced Puffed Rice Mixture Ingredients","image":"http:\/\/www.sailusfood.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/01\/marmaralu-mixture.jpg","image-small":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/marmaralu-mixture-150x150.jpg","image-large":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/marmaralu-mixture-300x300.jpg","style":["easy","quick","modern"],"course":["snack"],"special-diet":["eggless","gluten free","dairy free","vegetarian","vegan","kid friendly","pregnancy"],"cuisine":["andhra"],"cook-time":"5","prep-time":"30","main-ingredient":["puffed rice","peanuts"],"serves":"10","goes-well-with":["tea"],"author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Andhra Recipes","Festival Foods","Indian Festivals","Indian Snacks and Starter Recipes","Indian Vegan Recipes","South Indian Recipes"],"tags":["marmaralu","mixture","muri","puffed-rice"]}
