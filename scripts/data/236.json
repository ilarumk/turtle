Each home has its own variation to khichdi, right from the variety of dals, combination of vegetables and spices used, as well as the texture of the lentil rice combination.\r\n\r\n This nutritious, protein packed North Indian breakfast dish is given to toddlers as the initial weaning food and is also often eaten when one is feeling sick or is overcoming a bout of illness as its light, easy on the stomach and nutritious.From the Ayurvedic perspective, its considered the best light diet and is recommended for all the tri-doshas, Kapha, Vata and Pita. \r\n\r\nTo many, the humble khichri, evokes a medley of emotions, by the mere mention of the name, one either loves or hates it. I, for one love it and enjoy this soothing comforting bowl of earthy goodness.
