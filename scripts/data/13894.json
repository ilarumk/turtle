Most often I make a milk based ridge gourd dish, Beerakaya Paalu Posina Kura, which makes for a delectable side with both rice and rotis or beerakaya kootu or ridge gourd pachadi.\r\n\r\nToday, its a Beerakaya Tomato Kura, an everyday Andhra style vegetarian curry, simple to make and tasty. Do not omit the jaggery and saunf (aniseed) because they both give this curry a savory yet sweet flavor. Ridge gourd tomato curry goes best with rotis but tastes equally good with rice.\r\n\r\nRidge gourd Tomato Curry","image":"http:\/\/www.sailusfood.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/05\/beerakaya-tomato-kura.jpg","image-small":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/beerakaya-tomato-kura-150x150.jpg","image-large":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/beerakaya-tomato-kura-300x300.jpg","style":["easy","quick","modern"],"course":["main-course"],"special-diet":["eggless","dairy free","nut free","gluten free","vegetarian","vegan","kid friendly","pregnancy"],"cuisine":["Andhra"],"cook-time":"40","prep-time":"10","main-ingredient":["ridge gourd","tomato"],"serves":"4","goes-well-with":["rice","roti"],"author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Andhra Recipes","Indian Curry Recipes","Indian Vegan Recipes","Recipes Vegetable Dishes"],"tags":["beerakaya","tomato"]}
