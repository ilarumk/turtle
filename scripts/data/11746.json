I put a few to good use yesterday when I prepared tomato pepper rasam and today I used a few ripe ones to make a Chettinadu Style Thakkali Kulambu. Basic Kulambu is nothing but a tangy stew with endless variations based on the region its cooked. \r\n\r\nI first tasted this Kulambu recipe at a Tamilian friend's home. Her mother served us Thakkali Kulambu with Dosa and I fell in love with it. It makes for a delectable accompaniment with dosa, idli, chapati, pongal and rice. Spices like cinnamon, clove and cardamom bring a flavor and fragrance of their own while jaggery and coconut add a dose of sweetness that balance and complement the flavor of tangy tomatoes.\r\n\r\nThakkali Kulambu Recipe\r\nPrep & Cooking: 35 mts\r\nServes: 4-5 persons\r\nCuisine: Tamil Nadu\r\n.\r\n\r\nIngredients:\r\n\r\n5 large ripe tomatoes, chopped (use tomatoes that are slightly tangy)\r\n\r\n15-20 shallots, peeled\r\n\r\n1 onion, finely chopped\r\n\r\n1\/4 tsp turmeric powder\r\n\r\n1 tsp red chilli powder (adjust)\r\n\r\n1\/2 tsp black pepper powder\r\n\r\n1\/2 tsp fennel powder\r\n\r\n1 tsp coriander powder\r\n\r\nsalt to taste\r\n\r\n1 tsp grated jaggery\r\n\r\n2 tbsps coconut paste\r\n\r\n1 1\/2 tbsps oil \r\n\r\nTempering\/Poppu\/Tadka\r\n\r\n1 tsp mustard seeds\r\n\r\n1 tsp cumin seeds\r\n\r\n1\" cinnamon\r\n\r\n1 clove\r\n\r\n1 cardamom\r\n\r\n10 garlic cloves\r\n\r\nfew curry leaves\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Heat oil in a vessel.
