The sauce included peanut butter that added sweetness, red chilli flakes gave a touch of spice while lemon juice provided the tang. The roasted red pepper and carrots went well with the chicken and broccoli and the final garnish of cherry tomatoes and toasted cashew nuts packed that extra punch. \r\n\r\nUse seasonal vegetables and greens of your choice, shrimp can also be included while vegetarians can replace chicken with paneer or tofu. Makes for a perfect summer meal - quick (under 30 mts), healthy, light on the stomach and delicious! :)\r\n\r\nStir fried Broccoli Chicken Recipe\r\nPrep & Cooking Time: 20-25 mts\r\nServes 4 persons\r\nCuisine: Thai inspired\r\n.\r\n\r\nIngredients:\r\n\r\n1\/2\" ginger or galangal, julienne \r\n\r\n1-2 garlic cloves, crushed\r\n\r\n1 onion, cut into 8 pieces\r\n\r\n1 carrot, julienne \r\n\r\n1 red bell pepper, julienne\r\n\r\n1 small head broccoli, blanch in hot water for 2 mts, drain competely\r\n\r\n1 cup boneless chicken, cooked\r\n\r\n1 tbsp oil\r\n\r\ncoriander leaves or parsley for garnish\r\n\r\n4-5 cherry tomatoes for garnish\r\n\r\n7-8 roasted cashew nuts for garnish\r\n\r\nStir fry sauce ingredients (combine)\r\n\r\n3\/4 - 1 tsp red chilli flakes\r\n\r\n1\/2-1 tsp light soya sauce \r\n\r\n1\/2 tbsp lemon juice or vinegar (adjust)\r\n\r\n1-2 tsps honey or brown sugar\r\n\r\n1 1\/4 tbsps peanut butter\r\n\r\n3-4 tbsps hot water\r\n\r\nsalt to taste\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Heat oil in a large wok, once the oil is hot, add the ginger, garlic and onion and cook on high for a mt, constantly stir frying.
