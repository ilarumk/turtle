I decided to make Aloo Parathas for breakfast\/brunch since it meant less preparation work. The stuffing I make is super simple. Whatever variations of the stuffing I prepare, coriander leaves and green chilies are a constant. And I always use desi ghee to roast them, the flavor is simply out-of-the-world. Yogurt and pickle is our favorite side to go with Aloo Parathas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAloo Parantha Recipe\r\nPrep &amp; Cooking: 30 mts\r\nMakes 6 parathas\r\nCuisine: North Indian\r\n.\r\n\r\nIngredients:\r\n\r\nFor parantha:\r\n\r\n2 cups whole wheat flour\/atta\r\n\r\n1\/4 tsp salt\r\n\r\nwater to knead the dough\r\n\r\nFor stuffing:\r\n\r\n2 potatoes, boiled, peeled and mashed\r\n\r\n1 1\/2 tsps green chili paste\r\n\r\n1 1\/2 tbsp chopped coriander leaves\r\n\r\nbig pinch turmeric pwd\r\n\r\n1\/4 tsp cumin pwd\r\n\r\n1 tsp coriander pwd (coarsely crushed works good)\r\n\r\npinch of amchur pwd\r\n\r\nsalt to taste\r\n\r\nghee or oil to roast the parathas\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Add salt to the atta, combine, slowly add water to form a soft yet slightly firm dough. Cover with damp cloth and let it rest for 10 mts. Get the stuffing ready in the mean time.\r\n2 Prepare stuffing by combining mashed potato, green chili paste, coriander leaves, coriander pwd, turmeric pwd, cumin pwd, amchur and pinch of salt and combine. \r\n3 Pinch a large lemon sized ball of dough and roll to form a 3\" diameter circle. Place some stuffing and take the edges of the dough and cover the stuffing. Prepare with rest of dough.\r\n4 Dust the working surface with some atta and roll out the stuffed dough to form 6\"-7\" diameter circles.\r\n5 Heat a iron tawa and once its hot, place a paratha and let it cook for 15 secs. Flip the paratha and let it cook for a few more secs. Once light brown spots appear, drizzle some oil or ghee and roast to a golden shade on both sides. Use a spatula to press the puffed areas as the paratha gets roasted.\r\n6 Serve hot with any curry of your choice or yogurt or raita.\r\n\r\n","image":"http:\/\/www.sailusfood.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/04\/aloo-paratha.jpg","image-small":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/aloo-paratha-150x150.jpg","image-large":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/aloo-paratha-300x300.jpg","style":["easy","quick","modern"],"course":["main"],"special-diet":["eggless","nut free","vegetarian","kid friendly","dairy free","pregnancy"],"cuisine":["north indian"],"cook-time":"15","prep-time":"15","main-ingredient":["wheat flour","potato"],"serves":"5","goes-well-with":["yogurt","pickle"],"author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Flour Recipes","Indian Bread Recipes","Indian Breakfast Recipes","Indian Vegan Recipes","Indian Vegetarian Recipes","Lunch Box Recipes","North Indian Recipes","Recipes Vegetable Dishes"],"tags":["aloo","aloo-paratha","alu","paratha","potato"]}
