Ivy gourd (tindora\/tendli\/gherkins) is abundantly available throughout the year in our part of the world and finds it way to our kitchen almost every week. You will find numerous Andhra veg recipes using dondakaya on the blog since I love this vegetable. And am wondering why it took so long for today's recipe to make it to the blog. :)\r\n\r\nThose of you who have been following my recipes closely will notice that I add jaggery to many chutney and curry recipes. I like to add a hint of sweet which balances out the flavors in many Andhra style dishes.  Try this everyday vegetarian chutney that is eaten with warm rice, a dollop of ghee and sliced onion by the side.\r\n\r\n","image":"http:\/\/www.sailusfood.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/03\/dondakaya-pachadi-recipe.jpg","image-small":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/dondakaya-pachadi-recipe-150x150.jpg","image-large":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/dondakaya-pachadi-recipe-300x300.jpg","style":["easy","quick","modern"],"course":["side"],"special-diet":["eggless","dairy free","gluten free","vegetarian","vegan","kid friendly","pregnancy"],"cuisine":["Andhra"],"cook-time":"10","prep-time":"10","main-ingredient":["dondakaya"],"serves":"4","goes-well-with":["rice"],"author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Andhra Recipes","Indian Chutney Recipes - Pachadi","Indian Vegan Recipes","Indian Vegetarian Recipes","Recipes Vegetable Dishes","South Indian Recipes"],"tags":["chutney","dondakaya","pachadi"]}
