I kept aside some cooked rajma (kidney beans) to prepare a salad. Today, I made a Mexican inspired kidney bean filling for sandwich. Lovely flavors and made for a filling meal with watermelon smoothie on a hot summer day.\r\n\r\nIn a bowl, combine 1 finely chopped onion, 1 finely chopped tomato, 1 finely chopped small cucumber, 1 finely chopped small green capsicum, 1\/4 cup cooked kidney beans\/rajma chopped fine or lightly crushed, finely chopped coriander leaves, 1-2 tbsp grated paneer or cheese, 1\/4 tsp roasted cumin pwd, 1\/2 tbsp lemon juice, paprika and salt to taste. Mix well. (Vegans can replace paneer\/cheese with tofu)\r\n\r\nToast whole wheat or brown bread on one side, spread some mayonnaise or tomato sauce, place lettuce leaf and spoon some of the kidney bean filling all over. Place a toasted bread slice over it and serve.","image":"http:\/\/www.sailusfood.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/05\/kidney-bean-sandwich.jpg","image-small":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/kidney-bean-sandwich-150x150.jpg","image-large":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/kidney-bean-sandwich-300x300.jpg","style":["easy","modern","quick"],"course":["brunch","meal","breakfast"],"special-diet":["nut free","eggless","vegetarian","vegan","kid friendly","pregnancy","dairy free"],"cuisine":["Mexican"],"cook-time":"15","prep-time":"15","main-ingredient":["kidney beans","onions","capsicum","bread"],"serves":"3","goes-well-with":["juice","smoothie"],"author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Chaat Recipes","Indian Breakfast Recipes","Indian Dal Recipes","Indian Vegan Recipes","Indian Vegetarian Recipes","Recipes Vegetable Dishes"],"tags":["kidney-beans","rajma","sandwich"]}
