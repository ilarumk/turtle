I wonder why it took me so long to blog it. :) Better late than never. Prepared this classic Indian mithai a couple of days ago for a friend visiting me after many years. \r\n\r\nI used the regular orange carrots that are available in my local farmer's market. I could not find the deep red Delhi carrots hence had to make do with the regular ones. Ghee and condensed milk give richness to the halwa while warm spices like cardamom and cloves infuse it with an unmistakable aroma and flavor.\r\n\r\nGajar ka Halwa Recipe\r\nCooking Time: 50 mts \r\nCuisine: North Indian\r\nServes 4-5 persons\r\n.\r\n\r\nIngredients:\r\n\r\n2 cups grated carrot\r\n\r\n3\/4 cup lmilk\r\n\r\n2 cloves\r\n\r\n3 tbsps condensed milk\r\n\r\n2-3 tbsps sugar\r\n\r\n2-3 tbsps ghee\/clarified butter\r\n\r\n1\/2 tsp cardamom pwd\r\n\r\nfew raisins, almonds, cashew nuts, lightly roasted in ghee\r\n\r\nfew strands of saffron mixed in a tbsp of milk\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Heat 3 tbsps ghee in a heavy bottomed vessel, add the grated carrot and saute for 8 mts on low to medium flame.\r\n2 Add the milk and cloves and allow to cook till the milk is almost absorbed.
