The entries have been pouring in and must say that each and every recipe, I have seen so far, is a winner. June was the lentil month here at my blog and I enjoyed blogging all the recipes involving lentils. \r\n\r\nToday, I am blogging a favorite North Indian lentil recipe, Dal Makhani as my entry for JFI- Dal. Dal Makhani is a rich, hearty dish which is full of proteins. Black lentils and red kidney beans are simmered in a creamy sauce of butter, onions, tomatoes, ginger-garlic and spices and liberally garnished with cream. I did reduce the quantity of butter, ghee and cream in the recipe to make it less rich and keeping in mind - calories :)\r\nDal Makhani Recipe\r\nRecipe source: From my recipe files\r\nPrep & Cooking: 40 mts \r\nServes 5-6 persons\r\nCuisine: North Indian\r\n.\r\n\r\nIngredients:\r\n\r\n1 cup black lentils  (kaali sabut dal) \u00e2\u20ac\u201csoak in water for 8 hours and pressure cook till soft\r\n\r\n1\/2 cup red kidney beans (rajma) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c soak in water for 8 hours and pressure cook along with blank lentils till soft\r\n\r\n2 tbsp ghee\r\n\r\n1 tsp cumin seeds\r\n\r\n2 big onions, finely chopped\r\n\r\n2 green chillies, slit lengthwise \r\n\r\n1 tsp ginger garlic paste \r\n\r\n1 tsp kashmiri red chilli powder\r\n\r\n1\/2 tsp turmeric powder\r\n\r\nsalt to taste\r\n \r\n2 big tomatoes, finely chopped\r\n\r\n\u00c2\u00bc cup butter\r\n\r\n1 tsp garam masala powder\r\n\r\n2-3 tbsp malai (cream of milk)\r\n\r\nginger juliennes for garnish\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Pre-heat ghee in a heavy bottomed vessel.
