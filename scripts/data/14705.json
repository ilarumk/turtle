You will find most road side stalls located in busy market areas and along the highways in Tamil Nadu serving Parotta with Chicken Salna. The mere sight of this famous street food makes you hungry and crave for a bite of the flaky layered parotta dunked into the aromatic chalna. It is a match made in heaven and I always look forward to eat it when I visit Tamil Nadu.\r\n\r\nA fragrant watery chicken curry with a unique blend of freshly roasted spices like cumin, fennel seeds, pepper corns along with shallots, coconut and roasted chickpeas. One of the best chicken curry I have ever made and blogged is Chicken Salna. A must try recipe and I am sure that those who try it will add it to their recipe repertoire. Do give it try this festive season and it is best served with parotta and even biryani, appam or chapati.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","image":"http:\/\/www.sailusfood.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/12\/chicken-salna.jpg","image-small":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/chicken-salna-150x150.jpg","image-large":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/chicken-salna-300x300.jpg","style":["easy","modern"],"course":["main-course"],"special-diet":["eggless","nut free","gluten free","non vegetarian","kid friendly","pregnancy"],"cuisine":["tamil nadu"],"cook-time":"50","prep-time":"15","main-ingredient":["chicken"],"serves":"5","goes-well-with":["parotta"],"author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Indian Chicken Recipes","Indian Non-Vegetarian Recipes","South Indian Recipes"],"tags":["chicken","chicken-curry","salna","tamil-recipes"]}
