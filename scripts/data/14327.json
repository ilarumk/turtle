The Kodavas are born foodies, warm and hospitable people. During my boarding school days, I was fortunate to have good friends who belonged to Coorg. I learnt a lot about their culture, traditional attire, age old customs that are followed to date, rich cuisine, the tea and coffee estates including spice plantations. Last summer we had a memorable trip to Coorg. It was absolutely rejuvenating and we were treated to some scrumptious traditional Kodava cuisine.\r\n\r\nI tried to replicate a popular breakfast fare that we relished during our stay in Coorg ~ Akki Otti (aka roti) served with Ellu Pajji (sesame seeds chutney) and drizzled with honey. Akki Roti is basically a flat bread prepared with cooked rice and rice flour and Ellu Pajji is a nutty flavored roasted sesame seeds chutney. \r\n\r\nAkki Roti with Sesame seeds Chutney","image":"http:\/\/www.sailusfood.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/03\/akki-roti-coorgi-recipe.jpg","image-small":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/akki-roti-coorgi-recipe-150x150.jpg","image-large":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/akki-roti-coorgi-recipe-300x300.jpg","style":["easy","traditional"],"course":["breakfast"],"special-diet":["eggless","dairy free","gluten free","vegetarian","vegan","kid friendly","pregnancy"],"cuisine":["kodava"],"cook-time":"15","prep-time":"30","main-ingredient":["cooked rice","rice flour"],"serves":"5","goes-well-with":["chutney"],"author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Indian Bread Recipes","Indian Breakfast Recipes","Indian Vegan Recipes","Indian Vegetarian Recipes","South Indian Recipes"],"tags":["akki-roti","kodava-food-recipes"]}
