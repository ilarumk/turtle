Its the revered vegetable of Andhra cuisine and a family favorite.\r\n\r\nOften I try to prepare something different with it, away from the monotony. I tried Dahi Baingan, a North Indian style preparation to go with rotis and it didn't disappoint. There are a couple of versions of Dahi Baingan one of which is this particular recipe that I noted in my recipe files. A creamy style sabji that makes for a lovely side with rotis. Goes well with plain rice too. Next on my to-try list is another yogurt based curry, Kashmiri Dahi Baingan.\r\n\r\nDahi Baingan Recipe\r\nPrep & Cooking: 45 mts\r\nServes: 4-5\r\nCuisine: North Indian\r\n.\r\n\r\nIngredients:\r\n\r\n1\/4 kg green brinjals, wash and cube\r\n\r\n1 1\/2 tbsps oil\r\n\r\n1\/2 tsp cumin seeds\r\n\r\n1 chopped onion\r\n\r\n1 chopped tomato\r\n\r\n1\/2 tsp finely minced ginger\r\n\r\n1 tsp jaggery (optional)\r\n\r\n1 tsp red chilli pwd\r\n\r\n2 green chillis, slit half way\r\n\r\n1 tsp coriander pwd\r\n\r\n1\/2 tsp saunf pwd\/aniseed pwd\r\n\r\n1 tsp coriander leaves (optional)\r\n\r\n1 cup beaten yogurt\r\n\r\npinch of garam masala pwd\r\n\r\npinch of kasuri methi\r\n\r\nsalt to taste\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 In a bowl, combine yogurt, chilli pwd, coriander pwd, saunf pwd, salt, coriander leaves and green chilies.
