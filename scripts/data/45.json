In that recipe the carrot mixture prepared before combining yogurt, can also be used as a filling to make stuffed parathas.  I pack my son's Tiffin box with this 'protein rich paratha'. You can also use this carrot filling for sandwiches as well. Recipe for carrot filling.\r\n\r\nHere goes the recipe. Add some besan (chickpea flour) to the usual chapati dough. To 1 cup wheat flour add 1\/4 cup besan, 1 tsp caraway seeds or cumin seeds, pinch of garam masala pwd, salt, 1 tsp oil and mix well. Add water to it and prepare the chapati dough. I also add some fresh methi leaves and coriander leaves while preparing the dough. Keep the dough aside for a few minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPinch a large lemon sized ball off the dough. Roll into a small roti. Place the carrot filling in the center of the dough, seal it and roll into a ball. Roll to make a round paratha. Cook the paratha on the hot plate or tava till brown freckles form, when both sides are cooked, add a little ghee or oil and spread it on both sides of the paratha. Cook till paratha turns golden brown.\r\n\r\nServe with any curry of your choice or plain yogurt.\r\n\r\nThis way I get my toddler son to eat his vegetable and get the nutrition required for healthy growth.
