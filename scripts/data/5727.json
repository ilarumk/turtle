Tender crisp vegetables are cooked in a fiery sauce that has hints of sweet and sour flavors and a predominately spicy taste. The vegetables need to be cooked to the point where they retain their crunch, flavor and color, so do not overcook them. Makes a good side with noodles or fried rice. For a non-veg version, add some cooked chicken, prawns or fish pieces. \r\n\r\nSchezwan Vegetables Recipe\r\nPrep & Cooking Time: 40 mts\r\nServes 4 persons\r\nCuisine: Indo-Chinese\r\n.\r\n\r\nIngredients:\r\n\r\n1 onion, cut into 8 pieces\r\n\r\n1 carrot, cut into thin rounds\r\n\r\n8-10 french beans, cut into 1\" pieces\r\n\r\n4-5 babycorns, cut diagonally into two\r\n\r\n1 very small cucumber, slice and halve them\r\n\r\n1 green capsicum, cut into 8 pieces\r\n\r\nBring together the sauce ingredients:\r\n\r\n2 dry red chillis, de-seed and tear into pieces\r\n\r\n1\/4 tsp red chilli pwd\r\n\r\nlarge pinch of clove pwd\r\n\r\n8 crushed garlic flakes\r\n\r\n1 1\/2 tsps light soya sauce \r\n\r\n2 tbsps vinegar\r\n\r\n1 tbsp brown sugar\r\n\r\n1 tbsp tomato ketchup\r\n\r\n2 tbsps tomato puree\r\n\r\n1 tbsp cornflour\r\n\r\n1 1\/4 cups water\r\n\r\nsalt to taste\r\n\r\npepper to season\r\n\r\n2 cups vegetable stock or water\r\n\r\n2 tbsps sesame oil or peanut oil\r\n\r\n2 tbsps finely chopped spring onion greens\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Heat oil in a large wok and once the oil is piping hot, add the onion and cook till soft. \r\n2 Add carrots, beans and babycorn and cook for 3 mts.
