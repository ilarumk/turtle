The recipe is by no means authentic. I liked the flavors of cumin, tomato sauce and worchestershire sauce mingle with the vegetables and rice. The recipe calls for cheese and cream which I avoided and served the cooked mexican rice from pot to plate alongside some potato wedges sprinkled with some mixed dried herbs. Makes for a hearty meal.\r\n\r\nI am yet to re-create at home an authentic Mexican rice dish that I relished at a Mexican food festival. Friends, recipe or links to an authentic Mexican rice recipe that has been tried and tested would be highly appreciated.\r\n\r\n\r\nMexican Rice Recipe\r\nPrep & Cooking: 40 mts\r\nServes 4-5 persons\r\n","image":"http:\/\/www.sailusfood.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/09\/mexican-rice.jpg","image-small":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/mexican-rice-150x150.jpg","image-large":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/mexican-rice-300x300.jpg","main-ingredient":["rice","carrots"],"author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Indian Rice recipes","Indian Vegetarian Recipes","Mexican Recipes","Recipes Vegetable Dishes"],"tags":["features","mexican_rice"]}
