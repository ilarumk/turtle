Time had come to re-create it and savor the forgotten taste. Channa dal and cubed bottle gourd are slowly simmered in a tamarind based masala gravy until soft on bite. Deliciously tangy with a faint whisper of sweetness, the curry made for a hearty meal with rotis.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnapakaya Senaga Pappu Kura Recipe\r\nPrep & Cooking: 35-40 mts\r\nServes 4-5 persons\r\nAndhra\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\nIngredients:\r\n\r\n2 cups peeled and cubed tender bottle gourd\r\n\r\n1\/2 cup chana dal\/senaga pappu, wash and soak in water for 30 mts\r\n\r\n1 onion, finely chopped\r\n\r\nfew curry leaves\r\n\r\n2 tomatoes, finely chopped\r\n\r\n2 green chillis\r\n\r\n1 tsp ginger garlic paste\r\n\r\n1 tsp coriander pwd\r\n\r\n1 tsp red chilli pwd\r\n\r\nsmall lemon sized tamarind (soak in a cup of warm water and extract)\r\n\r\ngaram masala pwd (2 cloves, 1 cardamom, 1\" cinnamon stick)\r\n\r\ncoriander leaves for garnish\r\n\r\n1\/2 tbsp oil\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Heat oil in a cooking vessel, add the green chillis, curry leaves and chopped onions and saute till the onions turn transparent. \r\n2 Add the ginger garlic paste and saute for 4 mts.
