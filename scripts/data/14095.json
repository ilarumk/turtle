I have started my Christmas baking and am enjoying preparing festive treats for family and friends. The perfect time to pamper yourself and your loved ones. :) Well, its been a while since I prepared a rich chocolate cake and I have been craving for one.

I prepared a decadent easy dessert recipe, Chocolate Mud Cake with Chocolate frosting.\r\n\r\nChocolate Mud Cake\r\n\r\nThe mud cake turned out moist, dense and rich which my family and guests absolutely LOVED. I loved the addition of coffee which added a depth of flavor to the chocolate mud cake. \r\n\r\nMud cake with Chocolate Frosting\r\n\r\nI used chocolate frosting to adorn the cake but it tastes good on its own too.\r\n\r\nSlice of Chocolate Dessert","image":"http:\/\/www.sailusfood.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/12\/chocolate-mud-cake.jpg","image-small":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/chocolate-mud-cake-150x150.jpg","image-large":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/chocolate-mud-cake-300x300.jpg","style":["easy","modern"],"course":["dessert"],"special-diet":["egg","dairy","nut free","kid friendly","pregnancy"],"cuisine":["western"],"cook-time":"70","prep-time":"15","main-ingredient":["eggs","chocolate"],"serves":"6","goes-well-with":["ice cream"],"author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Cake Recipes","Festival Foods","Flour Recipes","Sweet Dessert Recipes"],"tags":["cake","chocolate","chocolate-mud-cake"]}
