Our backyard starfruit tree is full of fruits and my 7 year old is on a fruit-plucking spree. Just plucking, mind you, since the fruits are within his reach. He won't eat it. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSince June the tree has been bearing good fruit. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe anti-oxidant rich fruit starts out with a green color and ripens to a yellow shade. It can be eaten both at the green and yellow stages. \r\n\r\nCarambola aka Starfruit\r\n\r\nWhen sliced a perfect star is formed. Crunchy and juicy with a slightly tart and sweet flavor. I like it raw, sometimes with a sprinkling of chilli pwd. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote: I've learnt that people with kidney ailments should avoid starfruit.","image":"http:\/\/www.sailusfood.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/08\/star-fruit.jpg","image-small":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/star-fruit-150x150.jpg","image-large":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/star-fruit-300x300.jpg","main-ingredient":["star fruit"],"author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Fruit Recipes","Home Gardening","Misc"],"tags":["star-fruit"]}
