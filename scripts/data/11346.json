I love the texture and combination of spices that go into its making. The addition of one of my favorite flavors, anardana, adds a tangy punch to the nuttiness of chickpeas. This recipe is adapted from Anita's famous Punjabi Chole. Goes great with Bhatura, puri or rice.\r\n\r\nI couldn't agree more when Anita says that this recipe is sure to bring in the flavors of Delhi streets right into your home.
