It's a delight visiting the market in the winter season and watch vendors selling vibrant farm fresh winter vegetables like carrots, beetroot, cauliflower, green peas, pumpkin, capsicum to name a few and fresh greens like methi. Picked up loads of fresh methi, amaranth and spinach leaves. \r\n\r\nIt's a green(s)-intensive menu this week. Yesterday it was spinach soup and today I prepared an aromatic and flavorful stew featuring amaranth leaves, yogurt, coconut and green chilies. A classic healthy Andhra recipe that is sure to warm the body and soul. \r\n\r\n\r\nThotakura Majjiga Pulusu Recipe\r\nPrep: 15 mts Cooking 20 mts\r\nServes 4-5 persons\r\nCuisine: Andhra\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\nIngredients:\r\n\r\n3 1\/2 cups chopped amaranth leaves\/thotakura\/chauli, packed\r\n\r\n1 onion, sliced \r\n\r\n1\/4 tsp turmeric pwd\r\n\r\n2 cups thick curd (slightly sour curd)\r\n\r\n1 1\/2 cups water\r\n\r\nsalt to taste\r\n\r\nFor paste:\r\n\r\n4 tbsps grated fresh coconut\r\n\r\n3 green chillis\r\n\r\n1 tbsp fresh coriander leaves (optional)\r\n\r\nFor seasoning\/poppu\/tadka:\r\n\r\n1\/2 tsp mustard seeds\r\n\r\n1\/4 tsp methi seeds \r\n\r\n1\/2 tsp cumin seeds\r\n\r\n1\/4 tsp hing\/asafoetida (optional)\r\n\r\n10-12 fresh curry leaves\r\n\r\n1-2 dry red chilli, de-seed and tear (optional)\r\n\r\n1\/2 tbsp oil\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Add half a cup of water to thotakura (1\/2 tsp salt) except the onions and cook till they are half-cooked.
