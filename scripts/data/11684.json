I especially love their stuffed flats breads prepared in a tandoor. I tried to re-create the same at home a few days ago. So, prepared  Kulchas stuffed with paneer, cooked over stove top and served them with Channa Masala. Made for a hearty filling meal. I more or less followed this Paneer Kulcha recipe and am quite happy with the outcome. Tastes best hot off the stove\/tandoor. \r\n\r\nHow to prepare home style Kulcha:\r\n\r\n\r\nPaneer Kulcha Recipe\r\nDough resting: 2 hrs Prep & Cooking: 20 mts\r\nMakes approx 6-7 Kulchas\r\nCuisine: North Indian\r\n.\r\n\r\nIngredients:\r\n\r\n2 cups all purpose flour\/maida\r\n\r\n1\/2 cup warm milk\r\n\r\n1\/4 cup curd\/yogurt\r\n\r\n1\/4 tsp salt\r\n\r\n1\/2 tsp sugar\r\n\r\n3\/4 tsp baking pwd\r\n\r\nwater for kneading\r\n\r\n3 tsps sesame seeds\r\n\r\n2 tbsps butter\/ghee\r\n\r\nFor stuffing: Mix all the ingredients and make small balls\r\n\r\n1\/4 cup grated paneer\r\n\r\n1 onion finely chopped\r\n\r\n2 finely chopped green chilies\r\n\r\n1 tsp chaat masala\r\n\r\npinch of red chili pwd\r\n\r\nsalt to taste\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Sieve flour, baking pwd and salt. Place the sieved flour on a wide plate. Make a well in the center of the flour and pour sugar, milk, yogurt and slowly combine, to form a soft dough. Cover with damp cloth and let it rest for 2 hrs. \r\n2 After two hrs, knead the dough gently for a mt. Dust the working surface with some flour, pinch a large lemon sized dough and roll into a small thick roti. Place a ball of stuffing in the center of the roti and enclose it from all sides and roll into a ball. \r\n3 Dust the working surface with flour and roll the ball into a 6\" diameter thick roti. Sprinkle few sesame seeds on top and lightly roll with a rolling pin. Prepare rotis with rest of the dough.\r\n4 Heat an iron tawa, once hot, place the kulcha and cook for 15-20 secs on high flame. Brown spots begin to appear. Flip over and cook the other side for another 15-20 secs. Drizzle some ghee or butter and roast for a few seconds on each side and remove.\r\n5 Serve hot with any curry of your choice like Methi Matar Malai or Nilgiri Chicken Korma or Amritsari Chole.","image":"http:\/\/www.sailusfood.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/06\/kulcha-recipe.jpg","image-small":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/kulcha-recipe-150x150.jpg","image-large":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/kulcha-recipe-300x300.jpg","style":["easy","traditional"],"course":["main"],"special-diet":["eggless","nut free","dairy","vegetarian","kid friendly","pregnancy"],"cuisine":["North Indian"],"cook-time":"15","prep-time":"20","main-ingredient":["flour","yogurt","milk","paneer"],"serves":"4","goes-well-with":["chole","curry","dal"],"author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Indian Bread Recipes","Indian Paneer Recipes","Indian Vegetarian Recipes","North Indian Recipes"],"tags":["indian-flat-bread","kulcha","paneer"]}
