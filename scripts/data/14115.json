I thought I'd start a series on Eggless baking. Today, eggless cupcakes recipe is a never fail, tried and tested one and a dream come true for anyone who loves eggless cake. Super moist cupcakes that also have a light and fluffy texture and not to mention, very flavorful. You will love the frosting as well. Vanilla cupcake and chocolate frosting is a flavor combination that is incredibly addicting! I used a simple chocolate ganache to frost the cupcakes and the kids in my neighborhood gobbled them up in seconds. :)\r\n\r\nEggless Cupcakes with Chocolate Frosting","image":"http:\/\/www.sailusfood.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/11\/eggless-cupcakes.jpg","image-small":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/eggless-cupcakes-150x150.jpg","image-large":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/eggless-cupcakes-300x300.jpg","style":["easy","quick","modern"],"course":["dessert"],"special-diet":["eggless","nut free","vegetarian","kid friendly","pregnancy"],"cuisine":["western"],"cook-time":"20","prep-time":"10","main-ingredient":["flour","yogurt"],"serves":"18","goes-well-with":["frosting","ganache"],"author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Cake Recipes","Eggless Cake &amp; Cookie Recipes","Eggless Dessert Recipes","Flour Recipes","Misc"],"tags":["eggless","eggless-baking","eggless-cupcakes"]}
