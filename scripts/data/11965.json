I found the freshest farm grown spinach at the Farmer's Market (rythu bazaar) and decided on making a North Indian style snack - Palak Pakoda. A vegetarian and vegan Indian snack that is a crowd-pleaser. I love the crisp texture and flavors that go into its making. The green chilies and ginger are the main ingredients that set everything off. \r\n\r\nPalak Pakoda Recipe\r\nPrep & Cooking: 20-30 mts\r\nServes - 5 persons\r\nCuisine: North Indian\r\n.\r\n\r\nIngredients:\r\n\r\n3 cups packed chopped spinach leaves\/palak\/palakura\r\n\r\n1 1\/4 to 1 1\/2 cups besan\/chick pea flour\/senaga pindi\r\n\r\n2 1\/2 tbsps rice flour\r\n\r\n1\/2 tsp red chili powder\r\n\r\n1\/2 tsp roasted cumin powder\r\n\r\n2-3 finely chopped green chilies (adjust)\r\n\r\n1 tsp ginger-garlic paste\r\n\r\n10-12 mint leaves finely chopped\r\n\r\n2 tbsps finely chopped fresh coriander leaves\r\n\r\n2 tbsps hot oil\r\n\r\nwater as required\r\n\r\nsalt to taste\r\n\r\noil for deep frying\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Mix all the above ingredients adding salt as required and 2 tablespoons hot oil. Add very little water and mix. The batter should just coat the palak leaves and it should not be a flowing batter but a stiff batter. [Start with few tbsps of water and keep adding till the batter just coats the spinach leaves]\r\n2 Heat oil in a deep frying or heavy bottomed vessel. Once the oil is piping hot, reduce flame to medium and drop a little mixture of the batter to form fritters. Deep the pakodas to a golden brown color. Do not over crowd the vessel.\r\n3 Serve Palak Pakoda warm with a cup of masala chai or coffee. The pakodas can be stored in an air tight container for 2-3 days.\r\n\r\nPalakura Pakodi","image":"http:\/\/www.sailusfood.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/09\/palakura-pakodi.jpg","image-small":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/palakura-pakodi-150x150.jpg","image-large":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/palakura-pakodi-300x300.jpg","style":["easy","modern","quick"],"course":["starter","snack"],"special-diet":["eggless","dairy free","gluten free","vegan","vegetarian","kid friendly","pregnancy"],"cuisine":["north indian"],"cook-time":"20","prep-time":"10","main-ingredient":["palak","chick pea flour"],"serves":"5","goes-well-with":["tea","coffee","juice"],"author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Chaat Recipes","Flour Recipes","Green Leafy Vegetables","Indian Vegan Recipes","Indian Vegetarian Recipes","North Indian Recipes","Recipes Vegetable Dishes"],"tags":["pakora","palak","palak-pakoda","palakura","spinach"]}
