I am pleased to announce that I am hosting JFI for the month of July and am happy to do so.  \r\n\r\nIts the first time that I am hosting a food event and the ingredient I have chosen for the JFI event (July) is our staple, the primary source of protein in Indian food, a food which conjures up feelings of warmth and comfort and an essential ingredient the Indian palate cannot do without  \u00e2\u20ac\u201c \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Dal\u00e2\u20ac\u009d (LENTIL). North, South, East or West, every Indian kitchen cooks dal, which forms a major part of the daily Indian diet.\r\n\r\nDried legumes and their edible seeds, known as pulses, are classified into three groups - lentils, beans and peas which are rich in proteins, high in fibre, low-fat, easily digestable, with a wide range of colors, flavors and textures. Dals are the perfect comfort food, soothing with an earthy flavor and versatile with the ability to absorb many other flavors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rule is simple, you have to blog a recipe of your choice using any type of lentil (beans and peas included) as the main ingredient. It could be a tiffin like idli or masala dosa (urad dal\/black gram),sweet dish like bobattu (channa dal\/bengal gram),  every day dal dish (split yellow moong) or bisi bele bath , (tur dal\/red gram), rajma (kidney beans), chole  or dip like hummus (chick-peas). You can blog about desserts, savories, kebabs, soups, dips, stews, podis, salads, rice dishes etc using dal as the main ingredient. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease post your dal recipe on Saturday, 1st July and email me the link to your post along with a photo of the entry in 75X75 pixel size, the title of the post and blog name by Sunday, 2nd July to sailusfood@gmail.com\r\n\r\n\r\n Non-food bloggers and blog readers, who would like to participate and share their recipes, can send in their entries too\r\n I have created a colorful button for \"JFI- Dal\" event, you can download and put it up in your blog and help spread the word around.You will find the button (logo) along with the code at the end of the post\r\n\r\nI look forward to all the entries, discover new dal recipes from each region of India and the world, being blogged and showcased in the July round-up of the \"JFI - Dal\" food event. I appreciate JFI being made a  revolving food event giving other food bloggers a chance to be able to satisfy the desire to host a food event. I am sure there are quite a few, like me, who have a desire to host a food blog event atleast once..:). Thank you, Indira.\r\n\r\nFor information about Jihva For Ingredients food event, please visit Mahanandi.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote: \r\nAs its the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Dal\u00e2\u20ac\u009d month, I will be blogging more about dals in the month of June.
