Remember the Parotta recipe I posted last week? I had quite a few parottas sitting in the fridge that I put to good use by making Kothu Parotta and Chilli Parotta, both of which are popular street food fares of Tamil Nadu.\r\n\r\nThere are a few variations of restaurant style Chilli Parotta according to the region it is prepared. A very popular version involves cutting the flaky parottas into bite sized pieces, dipping them in a thin batter of spiced flour and cornflour and deep fried till crisp before being tossed in a coconut based gravy consisting of onions, caspicum and spices. There are no 'rules' to be followed for street food fare like Chilli Parotta recipe. It is versatile, in the sense one can add ingredients be it spices or sauces according to one's preference. A simple twist can transform the dish's texture and flavor profile and make it something special.","image":"http:\/\/www.sailusfood.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/12\/chilli-parotta-recipe.jpg","image-small":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/chilli-parotta-recipe-150x150.jpg","image-large":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/chilli-parotta-recipe-300x300.jpg","style":["easy","quick","modern"],"course":["snack"],"special-diet":["eggless","nut free","gluten","dairy free","vegan","vegetarian","kid friendly","pregnancy"],"cuisine":["tamil nadu"],"cook-time":"15","prep-time":"10","main-ingredient":["parotta"],"serves":"4","author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Indian Chinese Recipes","Indian Snacks and Starter Recipes","Indian Vegan Recipes","Indian Vegetarian Recipes","Recipes Vegetable Dishes","South Indian Recipes"],"tags":["easy-vegetarian-recipes","indo-chinese","indo_chinese_food"]}
