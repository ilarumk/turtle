Lived off salads, juice, tender coconut water and fruits for a good part of last week. Our backyard mango trees have given a reasonably good yield this year. Prepared both sweet mango pickle and Avakai using home grown mangoes.\r\n\r\nA salad I prepared recently is a mango based one with iceberg lettuce, cherry tomatoes and cucumber. I used honey mustard- mayonnaise vinaigrette which is simple yet flavorful. \r\n\r\nWash, pat dry a head of iceberg lettuce and tear into bite sized pieces and place in a salad bowl. Add a sliced cucumber, peeled and sliced ripe mango (large), handful of cherry tomatoes, finely sliced bell pepper. For salad dressing, whisk 1 1\/2 tbsps eggless mayo, 1 tbsp olive oil, crushed small garlic clove, 1 tbsp honey mustard sauce, 1\/2 tbsp honey, 1\/2 tbsp lemon juice, salt to taste, 1\/4 tsp pepper powder. Pour this dressing over the raw vegetables and toss well. Refrigerate until use. Finish with nuts of your choice. I used toasted cashew nuts.\r\n\r\n","image":"http:\/\/www.sailusfood.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/05\/mango-lettuce-salad-recipe.jpg","image-small":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/mango-lettuce-salad-recipe-150x150.jpg","image-large":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/mango-lettuce-salad-recipe-300x300.jpg","style":["easy","quick","modern"],"course":["main"],"special-diet":["eggless","dairy","vegetarian","kid friendly","pregnancy"],"cuisine":["western"],"cook-time":"0","prep-time":"15","main-ingredient":["iceburg lettuce","mango","cucumber"],"serves":"4","goes-well-with":["juice"],"author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Featured Recipes","Fruit Recipes","Indian Vegetarian Recipes","Raw Food Recipes","Recipes Vegetable Dishes","Salad Recipes"],"tags":["lettuce","mango","salad"]}
