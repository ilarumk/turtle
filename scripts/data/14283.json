I made a large batch of Strawberry compote and froze to make smoothies for Nehal during the hot summer months. Today, I made Strawberry cupcakes with strawberry cream cheese frosting. Sweet, aromatic and fruity where both the strawberry cupcake and frosting recipes incorporate fresh strawberries. While baking these cupcakes my kitchen was filled with an aroma that was amazing.\r\n\r\nFresh Strawberry Cupcakes with Frosting\r\n\r\nThe strawberry flavor is just right and the next time I make them I will add some fresh chopped strawberries to the batter. With a pretty pale pink color, the cupcakes were moist, not overly sweet and with the right amount of tartness. I made a cream cheese frosting that included cooked strawberry puree. It was slightly runny and I kept the frosting in the fridge for a while and frosted the cupcakes.\r\n\r\nIf you want to make a special treat for Valentine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Day, try these cupcakes and surprise your loved one. :)\r\n\r\nStrawberry cupcakes with strawberry cream cheese frosting","image":"http:\/\/www.sailusfood.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/02\/strawberry-cupcakes-cream-cheese-frosting.jpg","image-small":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/strawberry-cupcakes-cream-cheese-frosting-150x150.jpg","image-large":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/strawberry-cupcakes-cream-cheese-frosting-300x300.jpg","style":["easy","quick","modern"],"course":["dessert"],"special-diet":["egg","dairy","nut free","kid friendly","pregnancy"],"cuisine":["western"],"cook-time":"25","prep-time":"20","main-ingredient":["strawberries","flour"],"serves":"12","goes-well-with":["cream cheese frosting"],"author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Cake Recipes","Flour Recipes","Fruit Recipes","Sweet Dessert Recipes"],"tags":["cupcakes","dessert","strawberry-cupcakes","strawberry-recipes"]}
