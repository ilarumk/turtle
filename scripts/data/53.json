It is eaten with rice, or can be had as a soup. In a normal South Indian meal, rasam or chaaru is a must.\r\n\r\nHorse gram or ulavalu (Telugu), Kulith (Hindi) and Kollu payiru (Tamil) is a staple lentil of many South Indian farmer families. It is a small, flat, oval bean with a dark rusty tan color with an assertive earthy flavor. Horse gram is believed to prevent the formation of stones in the kidney and for those with the problem, consuming boiled horse gram water for one month will help to dissolve the urinary stone and can help cure it without surgery. It is also believed to be beneficial for cough and phlegm too.\r\n\r\nUlava Charu is a traditional Andhra Rasam. Its a thick horse gram lentil soup and is generally served with fresh cream or butter and rice. In our homes we serve it as a special dish for parties and weddings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIngredients:\r\n1 cup ulavalu (soaked overnight)\r\nsmall lemon sized ball of tamarind, soaked in hot water\r\n3 green chilies slit length wise\r\n10 button onions (peeled)\r\n2 whole dry red chilies\r\n10 curry leaves\r\n1\/2 tsp cumin seeds\r\n1 tsp mustard seeds\r\n1 tsp jaggery (optional)\r\n2 tbsp oil\r\n\r\nFor the Powder:\r\n1 tbsp whole coriander seeds\r\n1 tsp cumin seeds\r\n6 garlic cloves\r\nGrind coriander seeds, cumin seeds and garlic cloves to a fine powder and keep aside.\r\n\r\nSoak overnight the horsegram (ulavalu) and boil it in 8 cups of water in a fairly large pot.
