Often our lunch comprises of wholesome and filling salad or one pot meals and loads of flavored buttermilk. Yesterday, I made a simple and delectable chicken curry for our mid day meal. A regular Andhra chicken curry recipe with a slight twist. Cashew nut paste adds a touch of decadence, increases the flavor profile by leaps and bounds. Its one of our favorite chicken curry recipes that goes well with flavored rice, plain cooked rice and rotis. Try it and I am sure it will be a regular fare in your kitchen as well.\r\n\r\nAndhra Chicken Curry Recipe","image":"http:\/\/www.sailusfood.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/04\/simple-chicken-curry.jpg","image-small":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/simple-chicken-curry-150x150.jpg","image-large":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/simple-chicken-curry-300x300.jpg","style":["easy","quick","modern"],"course":["main-course"],"special-diet":["eggless","dairy free","gluten free","non vegetarian","kid friendly","pregnancy"],"cuisine":["Andhra"],"cook-time":"45","prep-time":"10","main-ingredient":["chicken","cashew nuts"],"serves":"5","goes-well-with":["rice","roti"],"author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Andhra Recipes","Indian Chicken Recipes","Indian Curry Recipes","Indian Non-Vegetarian Recipes"],"tags":["chicken","chicken-curry"]}
