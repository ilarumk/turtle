Must-have item on special occasions and a stir fry that is bound to convert hard core skeptics. It's the sort of thing you should make only when you come across fresh, tender, bright green tindora. Tender tindora is turned into a deeply roasted delicious stir fry that is simple yet elegant to serve as part of a special meal.\r\n\r\n\r\nDondakaya Kobbari Vepudu Recipe\r\nPrep: 45-50 mts\r\nServes: 4 persons\r\nCuisine: Andhra\r\n.\r\n\r\nIngredients:\r\n\r\n\r\n250 gms \/1\/4 kg Dondakayalu\/Tendli\/Ivy Gourds\r\n\r\n1\/2 tsp mustard seeds\r\n\r\n1\/2 tsp cumin seeds\r\n\r\n10-12 curry leaves\r\n\r\n1 large onion, finely sliced\r\n\r\n1\/2 tsp ginger garlic paste\r\n\r\n1 tsp red chilli pwd\r\n\r\npinch of coriander pwd\r\n\r\npinch of garam masala pwd\r\n\r\n1\/4 cup grated fresh coconut\r\n\r\nsalt to taste\r\n\r\n1 1\/2 - 2 tbsps oil\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Wash the tendli and nip the tip and tail ends.

Now reduce to low flame, place lid, let it cook, approx 15 minutes. Keep checking in between, sauteing them so that they don't burn. The sauteed tindora will lose moisture and begin to have a wrinkled appearance. Remove lid at this stage and saute on low for 4-5 mts.\r\n3 While the dondakaya is frying, take another cooking vessel, add 1\/2 tbsp oil, add the mustard seeds and let them splutter. Add cumin seeds and curry leaves and fry for a few seconds till the aroma emanates the kitchen. \r\n4 Immediately add the sliced onions and combine. Add salt and turmeric pwd and mix well. Saute on medium heat for 5-6 minutes, keep sauteing so that it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t burn. Add ginger garlic paste and saute for 4-5 mts. \r\n5 Add red chilli pwd, coriander pwd and garam masala pwd and combine. Add this entire onion masala mixture to the almost cooked dondakaya. Add the grated coconut and combine. Cook on low-medium flame for another 18-20 mts, without lid. Turn off heat.\r\n6 Serve hot with steamed rice.\r\n\r\nTindora Nariyal Sabji","image":"http:\/\/www.sailusfood.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/tindora-nariyal-sabji.jpg","image-small":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/tindora-nariyal-sabji-150x150.jpg","image-large":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/tindora-nariyal-sabji-300x300.jpg","style":["easy","modern"],"course":["side"],"special-diet":["nut fee","eggless","vegetarian","vegan","kid friendly","dairy free","pregnancy"],"cuisine":["andhra"],"cook-time":"45","prep-time":"5","main-ingredient":["dondakaya","tindora"],"serves":"4","goes-well-with":["rice"],"author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Andhra Recipes","Indian Fry Recipes","Indian Vegan Recipes","Indian Vegetarian Recipes","Recipes Vegetable Dishes"],"tags":["dondakaya","indian-gherkins","stir-fry","tindora"]}
