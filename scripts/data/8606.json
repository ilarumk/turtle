Pleasant cool weather during peak summer season is very unusual and called for leisure vegetarian cooking with warming flavors. Aloo Biryani and Capsicum Tomato curry was our meal this afternoon. Every day ingredients are all you need to prepare Aloo Biryani and it takes less than an hour to prepare. Do garnish with caramelized onions for that extra oomph to the biryani. :)\r\n\r\nHyderabadi Aloo Biryani Recipe\r\nPrep & Cooking: 45-50 mts\r\nServes 5-6 persons\r\n.\r\n\r\nIngredients:\r\n\r\n3 potatoes, peeled, cube and saute in 1 1\/2 tbsps of ghee for 8-10 mts till light brown\r\n\r\n1 large onion, finely sliced\r\n\r\n1 tbsp chopped coriander leaves\r\n\r\n1 tbsp chopped pudina leaves\r\n\r\n2 tbsps ghee\r\n\r\n1 tbsp oil\r\n\r\n1 cup thick curd\/yogurt\r\n\r\n4 green chillis, make a small slit in them\r\n\r\n1\/2 tbsp ginger garlic paste\r\n\r\n1 tsp red chilli pwd (adjust)\r\n\r\n1\/4 tsp turmeric pwd\/haldi\r\n\r\n1\/2 tbsp coriander pwd\r\n\r\nsalt as required\r\n\r\npinch of saffron soaked in 3 tbsps luke warm milk for 10 mts\r\n\r\nBiryani Masala - dry roast for 2-3 mts and powder:\r\n\r\n2 cloves\r\n\r\n1\/2\u00e2\u20ac\u00b3 cinnamon stick\r\n\r\n2 elaichi\/cardamom\r\n\r\n1\/4 star anise\r\n\r\n1\/4 tsp shah jeera\r\n\r\n4 pepper corns\r\n\r\nIngredients to cook rice:\r\n\r\n2 cups Basmati rice\r\n\r\n3 cloves\r\n\r\n3 cardamoms\r\n\r\n1\/2\" cinnamon stick\r\n\r\n1 marathi mogga\r\n\r\n1 bay leaf\r\n\r\n5-6 mint leaves\r\n\r\n1\/2 tbsp oil\r\n\r\n3\/4 tbsp salt\r\n\r\nwater as required\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 In a bowl, add green chillis, mint leaves, coriander leaves and ginger garlic paste, red chilli pwd, turmeric pwd, coriander pwd, biryani masala pwd and salt and combine well.
