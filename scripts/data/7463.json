It's comforting and unpretentiously rooted in Indian culinary tradition. Today, I'm blogging Mumbai's famous street food, my kind of comfort food - Pav Bhaji. Pav = Soft Bun and Bhaji = a mashed mixed vegetable curry prepared with Pav Bhaji Masala. The key to a good Pav Bhaji lies in the quality of bread and the masala that goes into the making of the spicy bhaji. Makes for a filling evening meal.\r\n\r\nFarm fresh assorted vegetables ~ Mixed Vegetable Bhaji \r\n\r\nThe bhaji makes optimum use of Mother Nature's bountiful supply of fresh vegetables. Not less than 7-8 variety of vegetables go into its making. Now that sure makes it nutrient rich, doesn't it? :)\r\n\r\n\r\nPav Bhaji Recipe\r\nPrep & Cooking: 50-60 mts\r\nServes 7-8 persons\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\nIngredients:\r\n\r\n1 large carrot, cubed\r\n\r\n2 potatoes, cubed\r\n\r\n1 capsicum, chopped\r\n\r\n1 cup cauliflower florets, chop\r\n\r\n8-10 french beans, string and chop\r\n\r\n1\/4 cup green peas\r\n\r\n2 onions, finely chopped\r\n\r\n2 green chillis, slit length wise\r\n\r\n1 tsp ginger-garlic paste\r\n\r\n1\/4 tsp turmeric pwd\r\n\r\n1\/2 tsp red chilli pwd\r\n\r\n1 1\/2 tbsps Pav Bhaji Masala\r\n\r\n3\/4 tsp sugar (adjust)\r\n\r\nsalt to taste\r\n\r\n2 tomatoes, finely chopped\r\n\r\n1 tbsp lemon juice\r\n\r\n1 tbsp low fat butter (vegans can avoid butter)\r\n\r\nfresh coriander leaves for garnish\r\n\r\n1 1\/2 tbsps oil\r\n\r\n16 lightly toasted in butter, pav bread (vegans can use vegan butter substitute)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Pressure cook potatoes, cauliflower, peas, beans and carrot along with 1 cup of water, till soft. Drain any left over water and keep aside. Mash all the cooked vegetables using a masher.\r\n2 Heat oil in a vessel, add the green chillis and onions and saute for 4 mts. Add the ginger-garlic paste and saute for another 3 mts. Add capsicum and saute for 2 mts.\r\n3 Add the chilli pwd, turmeric pwd, pav bhaji masala, sugar and salt. Combine well. Add the tomatoes and cook until soft, approx 5-6 mts.\r\n4 Add the mashed vegetables along with a cup of the drained vegetable stock and cook on high for a mt. Reduce flame and simmer for 14-15 mts.\r\n5 The gravy will begin to thicken. Adjust the salt, if required. Turn off heat and add butter and lemon juice and combine. Garnish with fresh coriander leaves.\r\n6 Serve hot with lightly toasted pav\/pau and sliced onions.\r\n\r\nNote: You can use 2-3 vegetables also while preparing the bhaji. I have not used cabbage and beetroot since I did not have them on hand at the time of preparation. Using beetroot will lend a deep reddish purple color to the bhaji.\r\n\r\nPao Bhaaji","image":"http:\/\/www.sailusfood.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/03\/street-food-pav-bhaji.jpg","image-small":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/street-food-pav-bhaji-150x150.jpg","image-large":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/street-food-pav-bhaji-300x300.jpg","style":["easy","modern"],"course":["snack","appetizer"],"special-diet":["nut free","eggless","vegetarian","vegan","kid friendly","dairy free","pregnancy"],"cuisine":["maharastrian","indian"],"cook-time":"40","prep-time":"20","main-ingredient":["pav","vegetables","potatoes","tomatoes","peas","cauliflower","onions","beans"],"serves":"8","goes-well-with":["pav","bread"],"author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Chaat Recipes","Indian Vegan Recipes","Indian Vegetarian Recipes","Maharashtrian Recipes","Recipes Vegetable Dishes"],"tags":["bhaji","chaat","pav"]}
