Past few days, I was involved in organising an event and travelling, with hardly any time to access my computer. All is fine at home and thanks for all the enquiries made and wishes sent by my lovely blog friends and visitors.\r\n\r\nIts time to blog now and today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recipe is a simple lady\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finger curry where tender lady\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fingers are cooked in dahi (curds). It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a recipe from Sanjeev Kapoor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Low Fat Vegetarian Cookbook, simple to make, tasty, low in calories and goes well both with steamed white rice and chapatis. \r\n\r\n\r\nDahi Bhendi Recipe\r\nRecipe source: Sanjeev Kapoor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Low Fat Vegetarian Cookbook\r\nPrep & Cooking: 30 mts \r\nServes 3-4 persons\r\nCuisine: North Indian\r\n.\r\n\r\nIngredients:\r\n\r\n250 gms tender lady\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fingers (I used baby okra, wash and pat dry with a kitchen towel, trim the top and ends)\r\n\r\n\u00c2\u00bd inch ginger piece\r\n\r\n\u00c2\u00bc tsp pepper corns\r\n\r\n1 tbsp oil\r\n\r\n1 dry red chilli (tear into two pieces)\r\n\r\n1 tsp cumin seeds\r\n\r\n2 green chillis slit lengthwise\r\n\r\n1 tsp coriander pwd\r\n\r\npinch of turmeric pwd or haldi\r\n\r\n1 tbsp besan (bengal gram flour) dry roast the flour stirring constantly till it gives a roasted aroma\r\n\r\n1 cup curds (made from skimmed milk)\r\n\r\nsalt to taste\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Peel the ginger and make a paste of pepper corns and ginger.
