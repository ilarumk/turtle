Going the salad way is becoming a regular routine at home. We had an abundant harvest of tomatoes this year. Tomato pickle was prepared last week. Today, I prepared an easy, breezy, cheesy, super simple tomato salad using little cubes of cheese and cucumber. Variations can include paneer, tofu or cheese of your choice. Loved the combination and the addition of cheese enticed my 8 year old as well as the boiled egg quarters you see in the plate. He loves eggs. :)\r\n\r\nDe-seed 2 large tomatoes and dice. Peel and dice 2 cucumbers. Cut a cheese cube into small pieces.  In a bowl, whisk 1 1\/2 tbsps olive oil, a large pinch of powdered sugar, crushed pepper, pinch of salt and a tbsp of chopped coriander leaves or mint leaves. Add the diced tomatoes, cucumber and cheese to the bowl and mix well. Chill and serve.\r\n\r\n","image":"http:\/\/www.sailusfood.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/04\/tomato-salad-recipe.jpg","image-small":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/tomato-salad-recipe-150x150.jpg","image-large":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/tomato-salad-recipe-300x300.jpg","style":["easy","quick","modern"],"course":["meal"],"special-diet":["eggless","nut free","vegetarian","kid friendly","pregnancy"],"cuisine":["western"],"cook-time":"0","prep-time":"10","main-ingredient":["tomato","cheese"],"serves":"3","author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Indian Vegetarian Recipes","Raw Food Recipes","Recipes Vegetable Dishes","Salad Recipes"],"tags":["cheese","salad","tomato"]}
