A low calorie paneer dish that has contrasting textures with melt in the mouth soft paneer and the bell peppers provide a flavorful crunch. It makes for a wonderful filling with wraps and a good side dish with rotis. There are a few variations to Paneer Jafrezi recipe but the one I am posting today is the one I like to hang on to and make pretty often.\r\n\r\nYou could saute the paneer in oil or ghee till golden brown before adding to the vegetables or use paneer that has been dunked in warm water for 15 minutes. And please do not omit roasted fenugreek powder aka kasuri methi when making this easy vegetarian dish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","image":"http:\/\/www.sailusfood.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/04\/paneer-jalfrezi-recipe.jpg","image-small":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/paneer-jalfrezi-recipe-150x150.jpg","image-large":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/paneer-jalfrezi-recipe-300x300.jpg","style":["easy","quick","modern"],"course":["side"],"special-diet":["eggless","dairy","gluten free","vegetarian","kid friendly","pregnancy"],"cuisine":["north indian"],"cook-time":"25","prep-time":"15","main-ingredient":["paneer","capsicum"],"serves":"4","goes-well-with":["roti"],"author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Indian Curry Recipes","Indian Paneer Recipes","Indian Vegetarian Recipes","North Indian Recipes"],"tags":["paneer","paneer-jalfrezi","paneer-recipes"]}
