The home made version turned out almost identical to store bought Bourbon Biscuits, well, 'almost'. :) Though they appear a bit rustic and cracked they have a great texture with soft chocolate butter filling. Nehal loved them and so did the rest who devoured them. I more or less followed Nina's Bourbon biscuits recipe. Thank you, Nina, for sharing the recipe of home made Bourbon Biscuits. \r\n\r\n\r\nHomemade Bourbon Biscuits Recipe\r\nPreparation: 15 mts, Baking: 15 mts\r\nMakes approx 22 biscuits\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\nIngredients:\r\n\r\n1 cup all purpose flour (maida)\r\n\r\n1\/4 cup unsalted butter\r\n\r\n1\/3 cup sugar\r\n\r\n1\/4 tsp baking soda\r\n\r\n1 tsp baking pwd\r\n\r\n1 tbsp cocoa pwd\r\n\r\n1\/2 tsp vanilla essence\r\n\r\n1 tsp golden syrup OR honey\r\n\r\n2-3 tbsps cold milk\r\n\r\nsugar for sprinkling\r\n\r\nFor filling:\r\n\r\n1\/4 cup butter\r\n\r\n1\/3 cup icing sugar\r\n\r\n1 tsp cocoa pwd\r\n\r\nfew drops vanilla essence\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n1 Sieve together flour, baking soda, baking pwd and cocoa. Keep aside. \r\n2 In a bowl, cream together butter and white sugar until well blended. Add vanilla essence and golden syrup and combine. \r\n3 Mix in the sieved ingredients with butter mixture and combine to form a soft dough. Add little milk to form the dough.\r\n4 Place butter or plastic wrapping sheet on the work surface, sprinkle some flour and roll the dough into a large roti. Use a knife to cut into rectangle shape pieces. Use a toothpick to prick over the rolled out rectangle. Sprinkle white sugar on top of each rectangle.\r\n5 Grease a baking tray and place each rectangle shaped dough on the tray and bake in a pre-heated oven at 155 degrees C for 14-15 mts or till the edges are toasted. Once baked, the cookie will feel soft on touch but once cool it will harden. Cool for 3 mts before proceeding with the filling.\r\n6 Repeat the process with remaining dough. \r\n7 Mix all the ingredients called for 'filling' and using a spatula spread some filling over the underside of each biscuit and sandwich using another biscuit.\r\n\r\nHome made Bourbon Biscuits","image":"http:\/\/www.sailusfood.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/bourbon-biscuits1.jpg","image-small":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/bourbon-biscuits1-150x150.jpg","image-large":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/bourbon-biscuits1-300x300.jpg","style":["easy","modern","quick"],"course":["dessert","snack"],"special-diet":["nut free","eggless","vegetarian","kid friendly","dairy","pregnancy"],"cuisine":["western"],"cook-time":"15","prep-time":"20","main-ingredient":["cocoa","butter","sugar"],"serves":"8","goes-well-with":["milk"],"author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Cake Recipes","Eggless Cake &amp; Cookie Recipes","Eggless Dessert Recipes","Flour Recipes","Sweet Dessert Recipes"],"tags":["biscuits","bourbon","chocolate"]}
