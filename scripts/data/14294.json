Summer has just started here in our part of the world with winter vegetables dwindling in the farmer's market. Last week, I prepared Peas pulao with sweet corn curry and raita. This culinary gem among North Indian dishes is quick to make and a party pleaser. Almost all korma style recipes, vegetarian or non vegetarian, make for great sides along with raita (yogurt based chutney).\r\n\r\nIt is the addition of fresh mint aka pudina and cinnamon which gives this pulao an irresistible aroma and flavor. Another variation is the addition of coconut milk instead of water while cooking the pulao giving it a rich flavor. So if you are looking for vegetarian rice recipes which are flavorful and quick to make, look no further. Peas pulao is a one pot meal you can never go wrong with. :)","image":"http:\/\/www.sailusfood.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/02\/peas-pulao.jpg","image-small":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/peas-pulao-150x150.jpg","image-large":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/peas-pulao-300x300.jpg","style":["easy","quick","modern"],"course":["main-course"],"special-diet":["eggless","dairy free","nut free","gluten free","vegetarian","vegan","kid friendly","pregnancy"],"cuisine":["north indian"],"cook-time":"25","prep-time":"5","main-ingredient":["peas","rice"],"serves":"4","goes-well-with":["korma"],"author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Indian Rice recipes","Indian Vegan Recipes","Indian Vegetarian Recipes","Lunch Box Recipes","North Indian Recipes","Recipes Vegetable Dishes"],"tags":["green-peas","peas","pulao","rice"]}
