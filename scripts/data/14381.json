I like a moist cupcake and my preferred choice of fat is oil. Since I like the flavor of butter, I use both butter and oil in most cupcake recipes that I try. Today's recipe is one that I have minimally adapted from Glorious Treats and is by far the best I have found in terms of texture and flavor. The use of corn flour gives it a light and airy texture. Due to the oil the cupcake keeps moist for quite a few days. The key is to not over bake as the cupcake tends to be dry and curmbly. My son is very fond of Nutella and I decided on a Nutella Buttercream frosting which turned out absolutely amazing with the Vanilla Cupcakes. Seriously, the cupcakes are so good on their own that there is no need for any frosting.\r\n\r\nVanilla Cupcake with Nutella frosting","image":"http:\/\/www.sailusfood.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/04\/vanilla-cupcakes.jpg","image-small":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/vanilla-cupcakes-150x150.jpg","image-large":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/vanilla-cupcakes-300x300.jpg","style":["easy","quick","modern"],"course":["dessert"],"special-diet":["egg","dairy","nut free","kid friendly","pregnancy"],"cuisine":["western"],"cook-time":"17","prep-time":"15","main-ingredient":["flour","eggs"],"serves":"15","goes-well-with":["frosting","ganache"],"author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Cake Recipes","Flour Recipes","Sweet Dessert Recipes"],"tags":["cupcakes","vanilla-cupcakes"]}
