In this recipe sliced brinjals have be shallow fried before combining them in a sauteed onion-spice base. \r\n\r\nJust ensure that the tender brinjals are not bitter and the resultant stir fry is satisfying on the palate and makes a great side with white rice and sambar. I used the left over stir fry as a sandwich filling with wheat bread and believe me, it tastes real good. \r\nVankai Vepudu Recipe\r\nPrep & Cooking: 30 mts\r\nServes: 3-4 \r\nCuisine: Andhra\r\n.\r\n\r\nIngredients:\r\n\r\n1\/4 kg purple brinjals, slice them into thin small slices\r\n\r\nbig pinch turmeric pwd\r\n\r\n1 1\/4 tbsps oil\r\n\r\nsalt to taste\r\n\r\nFor seasoning\/poppu\/tadka:\r\n\r\n1\/2 tsp mustard seeds\r\n\r\n3\/4 tsp cumin seeds\r\n\r\n12-15 curry leaves\r\n\r\nMake a coarse paste:\r\n\r\n2 small onions\r\n\r\n3-4 green chillis (adjust)\r\n\r\n3-4 garlic cloves\r\n\r\n1\" ginger piece\r\n\r\n2 tbsp coriander leaves \r\n\r\n1 tbsp mint\/pudina leaves (optional)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Heat half a tbsp of oil in a cooking vessel.
