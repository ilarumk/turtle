Not much of a recipe really, used left overs that I combined with spices, chopped onions and fresh coriander leaves and shallow fried till golden crisp. Fun, fast, healthy and tasty alternate to deep fried snacks. :)\r\n\r\nFor variation you can add some chopped spinach or mashed green peas or grated carrot.\r\n\r\nQuick Whole Wheat Bread Cutlets Recipe\r\n\r\nCombine 4 slices of crushed bread (soak in a tbsp of yogurt for 2 mts), a mashed large potato, a finely chopped onion, chopped coriander leaves, 1\/2 tsp kasuri methi, 1 tsp ginger-green chilli paste, 1\/4 tsp coriander pwd, pinch of amchur pwd, 1 tbsp roasted peanut pwd, 1\/2 tbsp corn flour, 1 tbsp grated cheese and salt to taste.
