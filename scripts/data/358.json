I first tasted these delicious chicken balls at a friend's place, whose mother-in-law is a cook par excellence. My queries on its preparation made Chandralekha Aunty invite me into her kitchen to share this recipe along with another dish, an Andhra sweet delicacy which I will also blog about soon. \r\n\r\nChicken Masala Balls\r\nBoneless chicken pieces, onions, fresh coriander leaves, green and dry red chillis, ginger, garlic, cashewnuts and roasted spices are ground to smooth paste and shaped into bite sized balls and deep fried (can be grilled too). The grilled balls are absolutely perfect on their own and offer a healthy alternative but nothing to beat the crisp deep fried version..:) \r\n\r\nChicken masala balls have a hot and spicy aroma that fills the room while being cooked and a flavor that makes these party appetizers almost impossible to resist. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve made this recipe twice these past few days and I can tell you, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a keeper, guaranteed to add flavor to a festive day like Kanuma.
