In most restaurants, while ordering biryani, they serve a gravy to go with it. The gravy that accompanies the biryani differs from restaurant to restaurant. Often, we try to recreate this subtly spiced gravy at home but with little success. Today's recipe came close to the restaurant flavor, a vegetarian version with absolutely no meat in it and goes well with vegetable biryani and pulao as well.\r\n\r\n\r\nSide Gravy for Biryani Recipe\r\nPrep: 10 mts Cooking: 30 mts\r\nServes 4-5 persons\r\nCuisine: South Indian\r\n.\r\n\r\nIngredients:\r\n\r\n3-4 cloves\r\n\r\n1 elachi\r\n\r\n1\" cinnamon\r\n\r\n2 onions, finely chopped or sliced\r\n\r\n1 1\/2 tsps ginger-green chilli-garlic paste\r\n\r\n3-4 small tomatoes, quartered or make a + sign on each, leaving them whole\r\n\r\n1 tsp red chilli pwd\r\n\r\n1\/4 tsp turmeric pwd\r\n\r\n1\/2 tsp coriander pwd\r\n\r\npinch of cumin pwd\r\n\r\nlarge pinch garam masala pwd\r\n\r\nsalt to taste\r\n\r\nfew curry leaves\r\n\r\n2-3 tbsps thick coconut milk\r\n\r\n1 1\/2 tbsps oil\r\n\r\nchopped coriander leaves for garnish\r\n\r\nDry roast for 2 mts and grind to a paste:\r\n\r\n1 tsp khus khus\r\n\r\n3 tbsps grated fresh coconut\r\n\r\n2-3 cashew nuts\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Heat oil in a heavy bottomed vessel, add cloves, cinnamon and cardamom and saute for a few secs.
