The key to a delicious tomato soup is in roasting the tomatoes. Use herbs of your choice. My favorite herb is fresh coriander leaves and I like a chunky tomato soup. \r\n\r\n\r\nTomato Soup Recipe\r\nPrep & Cooking: 30 mts\r\nServes 3 persons\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\nIngredients:\r\n\r\n4 tomatoes, apply oil and roast over fire, peel the skin, crush lightly\r\n\r\n1 onion, sliced\r\n\r\n2-3 garlic cloves, crushed\r\n\r\n1 clove\r\n\r\n1\/2\" cinnamon stick\r\n\r\n1\/4 tsp black pepper pwd or red chili flakes\r\n\r\nvery small pinch nutmeg pwd\r\n\r\n1 tbsp fresh coriander OR fresh mint leaves OR dried herbs of your choice \r\n\r\n1 tsp grated jaggery or brown sugar\r\n\r\nsalt to taste\r\n\r\n1 tbsp butter (optional)\r\n\r\n1 tbsp olive oil\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Heat oil and butter (optional) in a vessel, add the cinnamon, clove, onions and garlic and saute for 3 mts.

I like the soup chunky hence, I have not blended the tomatoes.\r\n4 Serve hot with croutons or garnish with fresh cream.\r\n\r\nNote: On a baking tray, place halved tomatoes, sprinkle herbs of your choice, 2-3 crushed garlic, drizzle olive oil over them and broil for 15 mts.

Cool, peel and crush.","image":"http:\/\/www.sailusfood.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/tomato-soup.jpg","image-small":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/tomato-soup-150x150.jpg","image-large":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/tomato-soup-300x300.jpg","style":["easy","quick","modern"],"course":["soup"],"special-diet":["eggless","nut free","vegetarian","vegan","dairy free","kid friendly","pregnancy"],"cuisine":["western"],"cook-time":"45","prep-time":"10","main-ingredient":["tomato","garlic","onion"],"serves":"2","goes-well-with":["bread","croutons"],"author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Indian Soup Recipes","Indian Vegan Recipes","Indian Vegetarian Recipes","Recipes Vegetable Dishes"],"tags":["soup","tomato"]}
