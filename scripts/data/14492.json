The day I prepare Pappu Pulusu, a tangy vegetable stew, for lunch, potato fry is also part of the lunch menu. It is a food combination that is immensely enjoyed in our home with warm rice. And am always on the look out for easy potato recipes that are tasty side dishes to go with Arisi Paruppu Sadam, Sambar rice or Bisi Bela Bhat. :)\r\n\r\nPotato Fry\r\n\r\nReally not much of a recipe but the innumberable variations in terms of the seasoning and tempering that flavor the roasted potatoes makes each version unique. I try to make different variations by changing the tempering each time I make potato fry and always find a subtle yet pleasant change from the monontonous everyday potato fry. Today's potato fry recipe has very minimal yet flavorful spices going into its making. Cumin, curry leaves, green chilies and turmeric powder are the essential ingredients that lend a lovely flavor and a colorful yellow hue to the fry.","image":"http:\/\/www.sailusfood.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/07\/potato-fry.jpg","image-small":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/potato-fry-150x150.jpg","image-large":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/potato-fry-300x300.jpg","style":["easy","quick","modern"],"course":["side"],"special-diet":["eggless","nut free","gluten free","dairy free","vegetarian","vegan","kid friendly","pregnancy"],"cuisine":["andhra"],"cook-time":"40","prep-time":"5","main-ingredient":["potato"],"serves":"4","goes-well-with":["rice"],"author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Indian Fry Recipes","Indian Vegan Recipes","Indian Vegetarian Recipes","Recipes Vegetable Dishes","South Indian Recipes"],"tags":["potato","potato fry","stir-fry"]}
