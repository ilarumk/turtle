Punched up with a good dose of lemon, the crunch of the peanuts and dals are perfect against the soft rice rava! \r\n\r\nRava Pulihora\r\n\r\nWhat I enjoy most about this recipe is the tempering with spices and curry leaves filling the home with a warming aroma. Comes together in a snap and flavor-wise is tremendously good! \r\n\r\nRava Pulihora Recipe\r\nPrep & Cooking: 30-35 mts\r\nServes 4-5 persons\r\n","image":"http:\/\/www.sailusfood.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/08\/biyyam-ravva-nimma-pulihora.jpg","image-small":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/biyyam-ravva-nimma-pulihora-150x150.jpg","image-large":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/biyyam-ravva-nimma-pulihora-300x300.jpg","main-ingredient":["rice rava"],"author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Andhra Recipes","Chaat Recipes","Festival Foods","Indian Breakfast Recipes","Indian Rice recipes","Indian Vegan Recipes","Indian Vegetarian Recipes","Lunch Box Recipes"],"tags":["rice","vegan_recipe"]}
