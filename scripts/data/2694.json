Today it was Aloo Bhindi. This is one of those simple recipes you can make over and over again and that is sure to bring a smile to anyone's face. I wasn't going to add tomatoes but was convinced by my North Indian friend to give them a supporting role along side bhindi and aloo. I am glad I took her advise. \r\n\r\nDelightful recipe that has the spices melding wonderfully with the sauteed vegetables to bring out fabulous flavors. And do not make this recipe without ginger and asafoetida, as they really pull the dish together. We enjoyed our soul-filling nutritious meal today. \r\n\r\n\r\nAloo Bhindi Subji Recipe\r\nPrep & Cooking: 40 mts\r\nServes 3-4 persons\r\nCuisine: North Indian\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\nIngredients:\r\n\r\n2 potatoes, peeled and cubed\r\n\r\n1\/4 kg bhindi\/okra\/bendakaya, trim ends, cut into 1\" pieces\r\n\r\n2 tomatoes, chopped fine\r\n\r\n1\/2 tsp cumin seeds\r\n\r\n1 tsp grated ginger\r\n\r\nbig pinch of asafoetida\/hing\/inguvva \r\n\r\n1 tsp red chilli pwd\r\n\r\n1\/4 tsp turmeric pwd\r\n\r\n1\/2 tbsp coriander pwd\r\n\r\nlarge pinch cumin pwd\r\n\r\npinch of amchur pwd (dry mango pwd)\r\n\r\nsalt to taste\r\n\r\ncoriander leaves for garnish\r\n\r\n1 1\/2 tbsps oil \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Heat oil in a cooking vessel, add the cumin seeds and let them splutter.
