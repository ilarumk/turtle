Feeling better today and decided to blog a very refreshing and nutritious salad I had this afternoon, Channa Fruity Salad, a recipe adapted from Tarla Dalal, the culinary queen of India. \r\n\r\nAll you need: combine together a cup of boiled chick peas (kabuli channa), onion rings, cubed cucumber, grapes, peeled orange segments, a tablespoon of honey, salt and pepper to taste. You can add any fruits of your choice. The salad is very refreshing, colorful and bright with the crunchy vegetables, the tangy sweet flavor of the fruits, laced with some pepper for that touch of spice and further sweetened by honey. \r\n\r\nI felt like eating something light and flavorful and this salad served the purpose. A plateful of this salad left me feeling refreshed with the comforting creamy texture of the boiled chick peas, crunchy  cucumbers, onions and fruits flavored with pepper and honey. Definitely a light, filling and tasty lunch that I have had in recent times. \r\n","image":"http:\/\/www.sailusfood.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/kabuli_channa_fruits_salad.JPG","image-small":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/kabuli_channa_fruits_salad-150x150.jpg","image-large":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/kabuli_channa_fruits_salad-300x300.jpg","main-ingredient":["white chickpeas"],"author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Indian Dal Recipes","Indian Vegetarian Recipes","Recipes Vegetable Dishes","Salad Recipes"]}
