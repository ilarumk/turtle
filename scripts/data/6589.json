Made for a wonderful side with Chicken Dum Biryani that I prepared on Sunday. The key to this recipe, which has its origins in the hill station of Tamil Nadu, is coconut, mint and coriander leaves which lends a greenish brown shade and infuses the korma with a mild sweet herby flavor, filling the kitchen with an aroma that is almost intoxicating. The use of aniseed (saunf) and cardamom add even more fragrance and flavor to the unassuming korma. I especially love the flavor and scent of mint leaves in this recipe. Its outright delicious! \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNilgiri Chicken Korma Recipe\r\nPrep: 15 mts Cooking: 40 mts\r\nServes 4-5 persons\r\nCuisine: Nigiri\/Tamil Nadu\r\n.\r\n\r\nIngredients:\r\n\r\n1 kg chicken pieces, washed\r\n\r\n2 large onions, finely chopped\r\n\r\n1 1\/2 tbsps ginger garlic paste\r\n\r\n1 large tomato, chopped\r\n\r\n1 tsp red chilli pwd\r\n\r\n1\/4 tsp turmeric pwd\r\n\r\n1 1\/2 tbsp lemon juice\r\n\r\nsalt to taste\r\n\r\n2-3 tbsps oil\r\n\r\nchopped coriander leaves for garnish\r\n\r\nDry roast:\r\n\r\n1 tsp cumin seeds\r\n\r\n1 tsp saunf\r\n\r\n1 tsp khus khus\r\n\r\n1\" cinnamon\r\n\r\n2 cardamoms\r\n\r\n5 tbsp grated fresh coconut\r\n\r\n8 cashew nuts\r\n\r\n1 tbsp roasted chickpeas\r\n\r\nRoast: (in 2 tsps oil for 5 mts)\r\n\r\n6-8 curry leaves\r\n\r\n8-10 shallots\/sambar onions\r\n\r\n4 green chillis\r\n\r\n3 tbsps chopped coriander leaves\r\n\r\n15 mint leaves\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Make a paste of ingredients under 'dry roast' and 'roast' by adding a few tbsps of water and keep aside.\r\n2 Heat oil in a heavy bottomed vessel, add curry leaves and saute for few secs.
