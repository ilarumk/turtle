Made vankaya pachadi (chutney), gutti vankaya kura (stuffed brinjals) and vangi bhath (eggplant rice) last week and my family felt that I was going overboard with eggplant recipes. :) I still had a good amount of this purple beauty sitting in the refrigerator that I wanted to use as quickly as possible. Today, I made an Indo Chinese style eggplant dish from Nita Mehta's book which I cooked for the first time. I tweaked it to suit my family's palate and it turned out reasonably good when paired with a bowl of hot steamed rice. \r\n\r\nYou can substitute the eggplants to what you have one hand. Okra, potatoes, paneer or tofu make for good substitutes. The original recipe called for the use of the large purple eggplants that are used to prepare baingan bharta but I used the smaller purple variety.\r\n\r\nIndo Chinese ~ Eggplants in sauce with steamed rice\r\n\r\n\r\n","image":"http:\/\/www.sailusfood.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/01\/eggplants-sweet-sour-sauce.jpg","image-small":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/eggplants-sweet-sour-sauce-150x150.jpg","image-large":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/eggplants-sweet-sour-sauce-300x300.jpg","style":["easy","quick","modern"],"course":["main-course"],"special-diet":["eggless","dairy free","nut free","gluten free","vegetarian","vegan","kid friendly","pregnancy"],"cuisine":["indo chinese"],"cook-time":"40","prep-time":"20","main-ingredient":["eggplants","tomato"],"serves":"4","goes-well-with":["rice"],"author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Indian Chinese Recipes","Indian Vegan Recipes","Indian Vegetarian Recipes","Recipes Vegetable Dishes"],"tags":["eggplants","indo-chinese"]}
