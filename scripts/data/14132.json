A version of the basic omelette that is much loved in our home is, Masala omelette. Makes for a quick breakfast and a filling one at that. If you are looking for a refreshing change from the monotonous omelette routine, try out today's omelette recipe. The Indian style of making the basic omelette includes the use of turmeric powder, onions and green chilies. I have gone one step further, threw in some vegetables and a pinch of garam masala. It changes the flavor profile of the masala omelette by leaps and bounds. You have to try it to believe it. :)\r\n\r\nCheck out the Vegetable stuffed Omelette recipe I posted at Kids Zone.\r\n\r\nMasala Omelet","image":"http:\/\/www.sailusfood.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/11\/masala-omelet-breakfast-india.jpg","image-small":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/masala-omelet-breakfast-india-150x150.jpg","image-large":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/masala-omelet-breakfast-india-300x300.jpg","style":["easy","quick","modern"],"course":["breakfast"],"special-diet":["egg","nut free","gluten free","kid friendly","pregnancy"],"cuisine":["indian"],"cook-time":"5","prep-time":"5","main-ingredient":["eggs","garam masala"],"serves":"2","goes-well-with":["bread"],"author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Andhra Recipes","Indian Breakfast Recipes","Indian Egg Recipes"],"tags":["eggs","masala","omelette"]}
