I usually blend the watermelon cubes along with fresh mint and serve chilled. Watermelon smoothie is another great summer cooler that is prepared using de-seeded and cubed watermelon, strawberry crush and honey. Simply superb! \r\n\r\nBlend 3 cups watermelon cubes, 3 tbsps strawberry crush or (7-8 fresh strawberries), 1\/2 tsp ginger juice, crushed ice, 3-4 mint leaves and honey or any sweetener of choice. Serve chilled.\r\n\r\nWatermelon Smoothie","image":"http:\/\/www.sailusfood.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/05\/kharbooja-summer-cooler.jpg","image-small":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/kharbooja-summer-cooler-150x150.jpg","image-large":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/kharbooja-summer-cooler-300x300.jpg","style":["easy","modern","quick"],"course":["drink","snack"],"special-diet":["nut free","eggless","vegetarian","vegan","dairy free","pregnancy","kid friendly"],"cook-time":"0","prep-time":"15","main-ingredient":["watermelon"],"serves":"3","goes-well-with":["snack"],"author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Fruit Recipes","Indian Drink - Sharbat Recipes","Indian Vegan Recipes","Indian Vegetarian Recipes"],"tags":["smoothie","tarbooj","tarbooz","watermelon"]}
