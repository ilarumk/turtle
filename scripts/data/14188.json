Carrot Rice fits the bill. A great way to use left overs with a fuss free rice recipe. \r\n\r\nI am gearing up for the holiday season with my son's school closing for a month long winter vacation from Friday.

My blog is home to a variety of Indian rice recipes using vegetables and Indian spices that work great for your lunch box or your kid's tiffin. Adding to the growing list of such rice dishes is today's Carrot Rice where the key ingredients are Kasuri Methi (roasted fenugreek leaves), whole garam masala spices and fresh coriander leaves. \r\n\r\nCarrot Rice","image":"http:\/\/www.sailusfood.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/12\/carrot-rice-recipe.jpg","image-small":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/carrot-rice-recipe-150x150.jpg","image-large":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/carrot-rice-recipe-300x300.jpg","style":["easy","quick","modern"],"special-diet":["eggless","dairy free","gluten free","vegetarian","vegan","kid friendly","pregnancy"],"cuisine":["indian"],"cook-time":"30","prep-time":"10","main-ingredient":["carrot","rice"],"serves":"4","goes-well-with":["raita"],"author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Indian Rice recipes","Indian Vegetarian Recipes","Lunch Box Recipes","Recipes Vegetable Dishes"],"tags":["carrot","carrot-rice","rice"]}
