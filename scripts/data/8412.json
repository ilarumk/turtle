Better late than never. :) At home, we enjoy taro root cooked in a tangy tamarind sauce aka pulusu. I also enjoy this starchy tuber in the form of a stir fry or chips seasoned with chilli powder and salt. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChamadumpala Pulusu Recipe\r\nPreparation: 30 mts\r\nServes 4-5 persons\r\nCuisine: Andhra\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\nIngredients:\r\n\r\n1\/4 kg chamadumpalu\/taro root\/arbi, wash, peel and quarter each root\r\n\r\n1 onion, finely chopped\r\n\r\n2 tomatoes, finely chopped\r\n\r\n2-3 green chillis, slit lengthwise\r\n\r\n10-12 curry leaves\r\n\r\n1 tsp red chilli pwd (adjust)\r\n\r\n1 tsp coriander pwd\r\n\r\n1\/4 tsp turmeric pwd\r\n\r\n1 tsp grated jaggery or sugar\r\n\r\nsmall lemon sized tamarind, extract pulp\r\n\r\nsalt to taste\r\n\r\ncoriander leaves for garnish (optional)\r\n\r\n1 1\/2 tbsps oil\r\n\r\nFor poppu\/tempering\/tadka:\r\n\r\n1\/2 tsp mustard seeds\r\n\r\nbig pinch methi seeds\/menthulu\/fenugreek seeds\r\n\r\nfew curry leaves\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Heat oil in a pan. Add mustard seeds and let them pop, add methi and curry leaves toss for a half a minute till the flavors come out and take care not to burn them. \r\n2 Add the chopped onions and green chillis and saute for a minute. Add the taro root pieces and salt and combine. Cook for 10-12 mts or till the onions and taro root are lightly browned.\r\n3 Add chilli pwd, coriander pwd and turmeric pwd and combine well. Add the chopped tomatoes and cook further for another 4-5 mts.\r\n4 Add the grated jaggery and tamarind pulp along with approx three cups of water. Bring to a boil and reduce flame and cover with lid. Let it cook for 8-10 mts till the gravy thickens slightly. Remember, 'pulusu' is a gravy dish and should be of a slightly watery consistency.\r\n5 Once cooked, garnish with coriander leaves and serve hot with steamed rice.","image":"http:\/\/www.sailusfood.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/chamadumpala-pulusu.jpg","image-small":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/chamadumpala-pulusu-150x150.jpg","image-large":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/chamadumpala-pulusu-300x300.jpg","style":["easy","modern","quick"],"course":["side"],"special-diet":["nut free","eggless","vegetarian","vegan","dairy free","kid friendly"],"cuisine":["andhra"],"cook-time":"30","prep-time":"10","main-ingredient":["taro root"],"serves":"4","goes-well-with":["rice"],"author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Andhra Recipes","Indian Curry Recipes","Indian Vegan Recipes","Indian Vegetarian Recipes","Recipes Vegetable Dishes"],"tags":["arvi","chamadumpa","pulusu","taro-root"]}
