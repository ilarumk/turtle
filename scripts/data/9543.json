Pachadi (Chutney), Pappu (Dal) and Avakai (Pickle) are the common preparations. I have blogged a pickle recipe as well as a pappu recipe using Dosakaya. Armed with firm, farm fresh Dosakaya, we prepared a tangy spicy pachadi that makes for a memorable side with rice and a dollop of ghee.\r\n\r\nDosakaya Pachadi Recipe\r\nPreparation: 15-18 mts\r\nServes 3-4 persons\r\nCuisine: Andhra\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\nIngredients:\r\n\r\n1 1\/2 cup dosakaya\/lemon cucumber, remove the inside seeds and cube\r\n\r\n1 tbsp senaga pappu\/bengal gram\r\n\r\n1 tbsp minappa pappu\/urad dal\/split gram dal\r\n\r\n1 tsp cumin seeds\/jeera\/jeelakara\r\n\r\n1-2 green chillis\r\n\r\n2 dry red chillis (increase or decrease to suit your spice level)\r\n\r\n4-5 curry leaves\r\n\r\nsalt to taste\r\n\r\n1 1\/2 tbsps tamarind paste\r\n\r\n1\/2 tbsp oil\r\n\r\nFor tempering\/poppu\/tadka:\r\n\r\n1\/2 tsp mustard seeds\r\n\r\n3-4 fresh curry leaves\r\n\r\n1\/2 tsp split black gram\/minappa pappu\r\n\r\n1\/4 tsp hing\/asafoetida\/inguva \r\n\r\n1 tsp oil\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Heat oil in a pan, add bengal gram and split gram dal and cumin seeds and saute for 4 mts on low-medium heat or till they turn golden brown. Add curry leaves, green chillis and red chillis and fry for another mt. Remove from pan and cool.\r\n2 First grind the spices to a coarse powder. Add tamarind paste and blend once more. Add the dosakaya pieces and salt and grind to a coarse paste. The cucumber should not be made into a paste. A stone mortar is recommended to crush them but you can use a blender too. \r\n3 Heat oil in a small pan, add the mustard seeds and let them pop. Add the split black gram and let it turn red. Add the curry leaves and hing and toss them for a few seconds till the flavors come out.\r\n4 Turn off heat and add the seasoning to the ground dosakaya pachadi and combine. Serve with hot steamed rice and ghee.
