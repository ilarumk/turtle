'Suvarnarekha', a variety of sweet mango is best suited to prepare mango juice. Its pulp blends well to yield a smooth creamy juice.\r\n\r\nThe next time you head for that Frooti or a bottle of Slice or Maaza, do yourself a favor by blending a glass of fresh mango juice to relish the real taste of mango with all its nutrients. :)\r\n\r\nPeel and chop ripe mango into pieces, place in blender with crushed ice, water and sugar OR honey OR date syrup as required. Blend to a smooth consistency and run through a sieve. Discard the left over pulp in the sieve. Pour into tall glasses and serve.","image":"http:\/\/www.sailusfood.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/05\/fresh-mango-juice.jpg","image-small":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/fresh-mango-juice-150x150.jpg","image-large":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/fresh-mango-juice-300x300.jpg","style":["easy","quick","modern"],"course":["drink"],"special-diet":["nut free","eggless","vegetarian","vegan","dairy free","kid friendly","pregnancy"],"cuisine":["indian"],"cook-time":"0","prep-time":"10","main-ingredient":["ripe mango"],"goes-well-with":["snack","breakfast"],"author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Fruit Recipes","Indian Drink - Sharbat Recipes","Indian Vegan Recipes","Indian Vegetarian Recipes"],"tags":["juice","mango","ripe-mango","summer-drink"]}
