A popular street food, Bhel puri, is prepared with puffed rice, an assortment of chutneys, peanuts and crushed papdi and sev. Garlic chutney is an optional ingredient and I personally prefer without garlic chutney. \r\n\r\nBhel Puri Preparation:\r\nIn a wide bowl, add a tbsp each of green chutney and sweet chutney and a dash of garlic chutney (optional). Add 1 finely chopped onion, 1 finely chopped tomato, 1 chopped boiled potato, 1 1\/2 tbsps chopped raw mango, 1\/2 tbsp of chopped fresh coriander leaves, 1\/2 tbsp lemon juice, salt to taste, 2 tbsps roasted peanuts and pinch of chilli pwd. Mix all the above ingredients well. Add 4-5 cups of puffed rice (murri\/marmaralu\/murmura\/kurmura) and combine well. Garnish with crushed sev and papdi. Serve immediately.\r\n\r\nBhel Puri Chaat\r\n","image":"http:\/\/www.sailusfood.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/03\/chaat-bhel-puri.jpg","image-small":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/chaat-bhel-puri-150x150.jpg","image-large":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/chaat-bhel-puri-300x300.jpg","style":["easy","quick","modern"],"course":["snack"],"special-diet":["eggless","vegetarian","vegan","healthy","pregnancy","kid friendly","dairy free"],"cuisine":["indian"],"cook-time":"15","prep-time":"10","main-ingredient":["puffed rice","potato","peanuts"],"serves":"4","goes-well-with":["tea","juice"],"author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Chaat Recipes","Indian Snacks and Starter Recipes","Indian Vegan Recipes","Indian Vegetarian Recipes"],"tags":["bhel-puri","chaat","puffed-rice"]}
