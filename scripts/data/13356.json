A vegan recipe that makes for a great party finger food. The standard Vegetable Pakora recipe calls for the use of mixed vegetables, chick pea flour and carom seeds. But I tend to tweak the recipe and add a few more spices to pep up the flavor.\r\n\r\nIn today's Vegetable Pakora recipe, I used carrots, beans, cabbage and potatoes but you can also add raw plantain, eggplant, caulilfower and pumpkin. Make sure to use fresh firm vegetables. Chickpea flour and carom seeds are essential ingredients that make the pakoras visually appealing and appetizing. But do add an extra ingredient, dry fenugreek leaves aka kasoori methi to your pakora batter which will elevate the flavor of the pakoras by leaps and bounds. It adds depth of flavor and keeps you coming back for more. \r\n\r\nMixed Vegetables","image":"http:\/\/www.sailusfood.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/12\/vegetable-pakora.jpg","image-small":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/vegetable-pakora-150x150.jpg","image-large":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/vegetable-pakora-300x300.jpg","style":["easy","quick","modern"],"course":["starter"],"special-diet":["eggless","dairy free","nut free","gluten free","vegan","vegetarian","kid friendly","pregnancy"],"cuisine":["North Indian"],"cook-time":"15","prep-time":"15","main-ingredient":["carrot","beans"],"serves":"5","goes-well-with":["tea"],"author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Flour Recipes","Indian Snacks and Starter Recipes","Indian Vegan Recipes","Indian Vegetarian Recipes","North Indian Recipes"],"tags":["pakoras","starter","vegetable-pakora"]}
