Dear readers, please give a warm welcome to Meera. :)\r\n~Sailaja\r\n\r\nMy Family Meal - Maharashtrian \r\n\r\nSailaja of Sailu\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Kitchen & Taste of India has welcomed a novice blogger like me to write an article on traditional Maharashtrian Thali - my family way. Frankly, I had jitters as I am neither a wordsmith nor a food expert.  The high standards set by Sailu herself, along with Nupur of One Hot Stove with her beautiful guest post on Maharastrian food made me quite nervous. But with Sailu\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gentle encouragement, I have decided to write this article. \r\n\r\nMy family is blessed to have a potpourri of different cultures of India. But since this is the Maharashtra series, I have kept the flavor Maharashtrian. The traditional family meal that I am talking about today is \"A traditional Maharashtrian meal\" and not \"The Traditional Maharashtrian meal\". There are many communities which call Maharashtra their home so each and every meal could be an individual topic of research. \r\n\r\nI come from a family with a unique blend of two different Maharashtrian communities - one strictly vegetarian and the other strictly seafood lovers. So when Sailu told me to write about our family\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s traditional home meals, I decided to divide this article into two parts. Family Thali - Vegetarian & Non-Vegetarian. \r\n\r\n1) Vegetarian Thali - (Jevanache Paan) \r\n\r\nA festive Maharashtrian meal can be very elaborate. It contains arrays of different vegetables, pulses, sweets and salads. The order in which the thali is presented is also given utmost importance. When arranging a meal, consider thali as a clock, the number 12 position is salt, to its left is a lemon wedge, and then to the left are array of chutneys, pickles (Lonache) and salads (koshimbeers). To the right side of salt are different vegetables like paatal bhaji (vegetable curry), paale bhaji (leafy greens), suki bhaaji (dry stir fry), usal (sprouts), Amti  (daals). Cooked white rice is molded in a small mound called bhatachi mood, with a bright yellow plain daal (varan) annointed with a dollop of clarified butter (toop). \r\n\r\nThere may be another variety of spicy rice dishes like Masale bhat. There could be two three types of chutneys typically a green chutney and panchamrit - a tamarind\/jaggery & nuts based chutney. Koshimbeer - raw salads generally paired with roasted peanut powder (daanyache koot) and flavored with either lemon juice or a plain yogurt based koshimbeer. Mattha - a spiced buttermilk is always served with such an elaborate meal along with a variety of sweets like jalebi, shrikhand, modak, puranpoli etc. There could also be some fried crispies like bhuji (fritters), kothimbeer vadi or papad or saandge & Kurdaya. \r\n\r\nIf the meal is for any religious festivities, onions and garlic are avoided. I have eaten elaborate meals during weddings and big family functions. There are some other mandatory rituals before actually eating the meal as well. You need to pay your respects to food which is considered poornabramha - God. My grandfather used to recite the following Marathi prayer: \r\n\r\n\"Vadani kawal gheta, naam ghya shrihariche \r\nSahaj hawan hote, naam gheta fookache \r\nJeevan Kari Jeevitva, Anna hey poornabramha \r\nUdar Bharan Nohe, Jaanije Yadnya karma\" \r\n\r\nI have given the meaning with the help of my mother.\r\nMeaning - Partaking food is not mere satiating hunger, it is in fact a yagya. The food is Brahma incarnate that gives life its living force. \r\nThe meal always ends with a simple thanksgiving prayer: \"Annadaata Sukhi Bhav!\" \r\n\r\nWith changing times it was impossible to put together the entire spread for every day meals. Due to work pressure, time constraints, calorie\/diet needs, smaller families, working moms, the meals were reduced but like all mothers, my mom tried to keep the essence of the traditional thali alive in our daily meals. A daily family meal at my home would consist of :\r\n\r\n1) Fulke - Wheat flour flatbreads roasted on the flame - We call it poLya. \r\n2) Bhaaji - (Any one or the combo of the following) \r\na) Stir Fry\/Suki Bhaaji - Mom always paired the vetgetables with sprouts. Green beans + Kala Vatana Sprouts, Green bean + Matki, Tondli + Chana, Yard long beans + Kala Vatana sprouts, Cabbage + Chana daal, Snake gourd + Chana daal or Field beans, Knolkol + Moong Daal. \r\nor \r\nb) Paalebhaji\/Leafy Greens- Every other day, mom tried to include leafy greens like alu\/taro leaves, paalak\/spinach, lal math\/amaranth, methi\/fenugreek, shepu\/dill leaves just to name a few. \r\nor \r\nc) Usal - sprouts were the part of daily meal either paired with the bhaji or stir fries by themselves called usals. \r\n3) Daal or curry - Mom served one type of daal daily. It could be plain daal - Varan or numerous versions of daal including Amti, Fodniche Varan, Ambat Varan, Kandyachi Amti, Jiryache Varan, Daal Vanga, Methi Daal, Lasnichi Daal to name just a few. or she paired daal with leafy greens or vegetables to save the time and still provided the best of the both. \r\n4) Koshimbeer - the raw salads either shredded, diced or chopped flavored with peanuts and lemon or yogurt as mentioned above. \r\n5) Bhaat - Plain boiled rice \r\n6) Dahi - The dinner would almost always end with simple dahi-bhat (curd rice) without any tempering with a small individual cup of homemade dahi set in every thali. \r\n\r\nSweet dishes and deep fried savories were reserved only for special days. Homemade Ghee\/Toop was kept on the table to serve ourselves sparingly. The essence of this vegetarian meal was Goda Masala.\r\n\r\nMy family Vegetarian thali \r\nPolya (chapattis), gaajrachi koshimbeer (carrot salad), cabbage-chana daal bhaaji, Paalak-Masoor Amti (Spinach\u00e2\u20ac\u201clentil sprouts curry), dahi (yogurt) \r\n\r\nRecipe for Mom\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Masoor \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Paalak Amti (Spinach & Lentil Curry)\r\n\r\nIngredients:\r\n1 \u00c2\u00bd cups Masoor sprouts\r\n1 cup spinach, roughly shredded\r\n1 small potato, peeled, diced\r\n1 small onion, chopped\r\n2 cloves garlic, minced\r\n1\u00e2\u20ac\u009d ginger, smashed but still whole piece\r\n1 small tomato, chopped\r\n\u00c2\u00bd tsp mustard seeds\r\n\u00c2\u00bc tsp asafetida\r\n2 green chilies, slit\r\n2 sprigs curry leaves\r\n1 tbsp jaggery\r\nSalt to taste\r\n3-4 kokums, rinsed\r\n2 tsp goda masala\r\n\u00c2\u00bd tsp turmeric powder\r\n1 tsbp coconut (optional)\r\n1 tbsp cilantro\/coriander leaves, chopped\r\nMethod:\r\n1.

Serve as a soup or with rice.\r\nNote: You can add more water as the amti is boiling. But adjust salt accordingly.\r\n\r\n\r\n2) Non-vegetarian Thali - ( Sunday Special)\r\n\r\nSix days out of seven were vegetarian food, so Sunday was reserved for the non-vegetarian bonanza. We would really look forward to the Sunday special non-veg meal. Traditionally, my family ate only seafood but somewhere the last generation also started eating eggs, chicken and mutton. My mom learnt to cook meat only after her marriage. A typical Sunday meal would consist of :\r\n\r\n1) Curry - Chicken or Mutton or Seafood like Pomfret Curry (baajarachi Amti)\r\n2) Fried Seafood - Tallela Baajaar\/Fried fish\r\n3) Soul Kadhi\/Footi Kadhi - A cooling drink which is also considered as a digestive aid.\r\n4) Plain rice\r\n5) PoLya\r\n6) Koshimbeer - mostly sliced cucumbers, onions, tomatoes & lemon wedges\r\n7) Paaley bhaaji - some leafy greens stir fry\r\nSome times a rare indulgence of meetha paan as an after-meal bonus was allowed.\r\n\r\nMy family Non-Vegetarian thali\r\nSunday Special Thali - Rice, poLya (chapattis), salad, chicken curry, fried fish, Dhemse-chana daal bhaji (roundgourd+chana daal)\r\n\r\nRecipe for Mom\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fried Fish\r\n\r\nIngredients:\r\n4 fish steaks (like pomfret, king fish etc)\r\n\u00c2\u00bd tsp turmeric powder\r\nSalt to taste\r\n1 tsp chili powder\r\n\u00c2\u00bc tsp asafetida\r\nCoarse rice powder or semolina to dredge\r\nOil for shallow frying\r\nMethod:\r\n1.
