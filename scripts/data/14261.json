Murukku, also known as Chakli, Murukulu and Jantikalu, is a favorite savory snack in our home. A traditional and classic snack that is crunchy and addictive with a cup of coffee or masala chai. Perfect to serve guests and works great as an after school Indian snack for kids. You can never stop with one or two of these gluten free delights. \r\n\r\nThere are a few variations to the Murukku recipe that has rice flour as its key ingredient. Either urad dal flour, chickpeas flour or roasted chickpeas flour goes in and adds color and flavor along with cumin or carom seeds or sesame seeds. You have unlimited variations in flavor or shapes to chose from and as a newbie you will need a little practice to make the concentric circles. A janthikalu press with a single star shaped disc is essential to prepare this culinary gem among South Indian recipes.\r\n\r\nMurukku","image":"http:\/\/www.sailusfood.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/01\/murukku-snack-recipe.jpg","image-small":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/murukku-snack-recipe-150x150.jpg","image-large":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/murukku-snack-recipe-300x300.jpg","style":["easy","traditional"],"course":["snack"],"special-diet":["eggless","dairy free","nut free","gluten free","vegetarian","vegan","kid friendly","pregnancy"],"cuisine":["south indian"],"cook-time":"45","prep-time":"30","main-ingredient":["rice flour"],"serves":"40","goes-well-with":["tea","coffee"],"author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Andhra Recipes","Festival Foods","Flour Recipes","Indian Snacks and Starter Recipes","Indian Vegetarian Recipes","South Indian Recipes"],"tags":["murukku","murukulu","snacks"]}
