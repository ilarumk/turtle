High fibre,  cracked wheat is nothing but crushed whole wheat kernels. Cook it like you would rice at the ratio of 1:2 i.e 1 cup dalia and 2 cups water. I tried a Mediterranean inspired recipe that calls for couscous and bell peppers. Replaced couscous with dalia and I had a vibrant vegetarian meal bursting with color, flavor and textures. Made for a quick, healthy and tasty vegan meal.\r\n\r\nYou can add a cup of boiled chickpeas or cubed and cooked boneless chicken to make it protein rich.\r\n\r\nCracked Wheat with Roasted Vegetables Recipe\r\nPrep & Cooking Time: 30 mts\r\nServes 4 persons\r\nCuisine: Thai inspired\r\n.\r\n\r\nIngredients:\r\n\r\n1 cup, dry roasted dalia\/cracked wheat (roast on low flame for 7-8 mts)\r\n\r\n1\/2 tsp cumin seeds\r\n\r\n3\/4 tsp saunf\/aniseed pwd\r\n\r\n1 tsp red chilli pwd or paprika\r\n\r\n4 garlic cloves, lightly crushed\r\n\r\n1 onion, sliced\r\n\r\n1 carrot, julienne \r\n\r\n1 red bell pepper, cut into 1\" squares\r\n\r\n1 yellow pepper, cut into 1\" squares\r\n\r\n1 egglant\/baigan or zucchini, cubed\r\n\r\n1 tomato, pureed\r\n\r\n1 1\/2 tsps maida\r\n\r\n1 1\/2 tbsps olive oil\r\n\r\ncoriander leaves or parsley for garnish\r\n\r\n1 tsp lemon juice (optional)\r\n\r\nsalt to taste\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Bring 2 cups of water to a boil, add 1\/2 tsp salt and add the washed and drained cracked wheat.
