Very quick to make provided you have coconut milk on hand. I used fresh home made coconut milk using home grown coconuts. The egg curry made for a divine accompaniment with Idiyappam.\r\n\r\nThe finishing touch of freshly ground black pepper and fresh curry leaves are the key elements of Kerala egg curry. Of course, the thick coconut milk lends the curry a creamy sauce and an irresistible aroma and flavor. Don't you love the gorgeous color of the curry? :)\r\n\r\nKerala style Egg Curry","image":"http:\/\/www.sailusfood.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/11\/kerala-egg-curry.jpg","image-small":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/kerala-egg-curry-150x150.jpg","image-large":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/kerala-egg-curry-300x300.jpg","style":["easy","quick","traditional"],"course":["main-course"],"special-diet":["egg","dairy free","nut free","kid friendly","pregnancy"],"cuisine":["kerala"],"cook-time":"20","prep-time":"10","main-ingredient":["eggs","coconut milk"],"serves":"4","goes-well-with":["appam","idiyappam"],"author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Indian Curry Recipes","Indian Egg Recipes","Kerala Recipes"],"tags":["egg","egg-curry","kerala"]}
