In case you don't know who Darren Rowse is - he is an Australian blogger who blogs on blogging tips and how to make money through blogging. In Darren's words,\r\n     \r\nI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been chatting with a few bloggers of late who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been feeling a little down in the dumps about their blogging - so perhaps everyone could do with a little lift.\r\n\r\n    Lets spend today doing a few random acts of kindness and encouragement for our fellow bloggers.\r\n\r\n    I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not writing this in the hope of getting more emails myself (I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got my share for today already) - but instead want to encourage you to take a moment to email another blogger and to thank them for something that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve appreciated about what they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve done lately. In a sense it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcPay it Forward\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 exercise.\r\n\r\nWe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in it together, blogging is about collaboration and together going further than we can by ourselves - so why not help another blogger today by shooting them a word of encouragement, a pep talk, a congratulations, an idea to help them improve or some other positive constructive message. Better still, do it publicly on your blog and tell the world about another blogger who you appreciate.\"\r\n\r\n\"Appreciation according to the dictionary \r\n\r\n   1. Recognition of the quality, value, significance, or magnitude of people and things.\r\n   2. A judgment or opinion, especially a favorable one.\r\n   3. An expression of gratitude.\r\n   4. Awareness or delicate perception, especially of aesthetic qualities or values.\r\n\r\n\r\nBasically today we can take a moment to encourage bloggers for their efforts by saying a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcThank You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and tell them how much their work is appreciated via comments, emails or even posting on your own blog. \r\n\r\nI want to utilize this opportunity to appreciate all my food blogger friends and colleagues for your sincere selfless efforts in sharing family recipes, food photos, hosting wonderful food events, raising funds for worthy causes and inspiring writing. In other words, putting your soul into food blogging. All through the ups and downs of blogging life, whenever I felt low, stressed out and uninspired, its my blogging colleagues who made a positive impact with their ever inspiring work, sense of community and strong camaraderie. \r\n\r\nThank you, dear blogger friends, for being a major source of inspiration to me and for supporting me always by your appreciative comments, constructive feedback and link love. My best wishes to each and every blogger colleague and friend. And Happy Vishu! -:)","image":"http:\/\/www.sailusfood.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/rose.JPG","image-small":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/rose-150x150.jpg","image-large":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/rose-300x300.jpg","author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Misc","Personal"],"tags":["blogging"]}
