Its healthy, very tasty and easy to make as well. You can use this pattie as a filling for the burger and eat it just as a pattie\/cutlet.\r\n\r\nMix together one mashed boiled potato, one mashed boiled carrot, 1\/2 tsp of white pepper pwd (you can use black pepper as well or chopped green chillis), 1 tbsp of grated cheese, salt to taste, 1 tbsp of bread crumbs (I used powdered rusks as it has a nice flavor). (You can use any vegetable of your choice. Sometimes I add chopped palak (spinach) too.\r\n\r\nMix well and make the shape of a pattie. Make a bigger patty if you are using it to make a burger. Heat a non-stick pan and add 1 tsp oil and shallow fry the pattis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFry well on both sides till they turn golden brown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the burger:\r\nSlice a bun (for a burger) and slightly toast it. Spread tomato ketchup on the toasted side of the bun and place the vegetable patti on it. Now place thin onion, tomato and cucumber slices over it. (You can use mayonnaise also)\r\n\r\n\r\n","course":["breakfast","snack"],"special-diet":["nut free","eggless","vegetarian","healthy","kid friendly","pregnancy"],"cuisine":["western"],"cook-time":"30","prep-time":"10","main-ingredient":["potato","carrot","cheese"],"author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Chaat Recipes","Indian Breakfast Recipes","Indian Vegetarian Recipes","Recipes Vegetable Dishes"],"tags":["burger","vegetable-pattie"]}
