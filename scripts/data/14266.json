The fridge is always stocked with at least 2 pounds of this Vitamin A rich vegetable. Last week, I made a simple sesame flavored carrot fry that made for a delectable side with rice and sambar. I would rate as one of the best Indian vegetarian recipes using carrots.\r\n\r\nCarrot Fry\r\n\r\nThis is a basic carrot fry recipe and you can play around with whatever ingredients you have on hand. I used toasted sesame seeds and coriander powder as the main spices which made for a good combination of flavors. You can add a dash of cumin powder and dry fenugreek leaves (methi) for a flavor variation. I would suggest using curry leaves during the tempering process as they lend a unique aroma to the carrot fry.","image":"http:\/\/www.sailusfood.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/01\/carrot-fry.jpg","image-small":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/carrot-fry-150x150.jpg","image-large":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/carrot-fry-300x300.jpg","style":["easy","quick","modern"],"course":["side"],"special-diet":["eggless","dairy free","nut free","gluten free","vegetarian","vegan","kid friendly","pregnancy"],"cuisine":["andhra"],"cook-time":"35","prep-time":"10","main-ingredient":["carrot"],"serves":"4","goes-well-with":["rice","roti"],"author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Andhra Recipes","Indian Fry Recipes","Indian Vegan Recipes","Indian Vegetarian Recipes","Recipes Vegetable Dishes","South Indian Recipes"],"tags":["carrot","carrot-fry"]}
