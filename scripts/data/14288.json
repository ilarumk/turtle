I had prepared Corn manchurian as an evening snack for Nehal. There are hardly any corn recipes on my blog and I was hoping to blog Corn Manchurian but realized that my hubby had taken the camera with him and hence I could not take any pictures. \r\n\r\nI refrigerated the left over Corn Manchurian hoping to give it a make over. On busy or lazy days when you want to spend less time in the kitchen, left overs come to the rescue. Today was one such day and I decided to use left over rice and manchurian to make a quick one pot meal. A flavorful recipe with minimal ingredients using Indian Chinese cooking technique and spices.\r\n\r\nIndian Chinese style fried rice with corn manchurian","image":"http:\/\/www.sailusfood.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/02\/corn-manchurian-fried-rice.jpg","image-small":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/corn-manchurian-fried-rice-150x150.jpg","image-large":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/corn-manchurian-fried-rice-300x300.jpg","style":["easy","quick","modern"],"course":["main-course"],"special-diet":["eggless","dairy free","nut free","gluten free","vegetarian","vegan","kid friendly","pregnancy"],"cuisine":["indo chinese"],"cook-time":"30","prep-time":"20","main-ingredient":["sweet corn","rice"],"serves":"4","goes-well-with":["tomato sauce"],"author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Indian Chinese Recipes","Indian Rice recipes","Indian Vegan Recipes","Indian Vegetarian Recipes","Lunch Box Recipes","Recipes Vegetable Dishes"],"tags":["corn","fried-rice","indo_chinese_food","manchurian","sweet-corn"]}
