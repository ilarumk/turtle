Thank you Lakshmi for your effort and time in bringing to us delectable plates of not one but two tiffin items. Friends, please welcome Lakshmi. :)\r\n\r\n~ Sailaja \r\n\r\nTRADITIONAL TAMIL TIFFINS\r\n\r\nA plate of steaming hot idlis served with sambar and chutney on the side is what comes to mind the moment you think of a Tamil tiffin. While idlis are the most commonly available Tamil tiffin, the spread includes a whole lot of other varieties of tiffins and accompaniments. Step into any South Indian restaurant and you will find a whole array of popular Tamil tiffins like idly, dosa, vada, pongal, rava idli, uthappam, rava dosa, etc. \r\n\r\nWhat you will not find on restaurant menus are traditional home made recipes like upma kozhakattai, sevai, aapam, kuzhi paniyaram, adai, idiyappam (also a Kerala delicacy) etc. Restaurants apart, mobile vendors (also called 'Kayendhi Bhavan') whip up delicious and fresh tiffins right out of their carts. As a kid, I remember eating at these Kayendhi Bhavans whenever we embarked on a long road trip. It was like a ritual in our family. \r\n\r\nBreakfast is not the only meal where tiffins are consumed. They are also a great alternative when you need a light evening snack. Some of the recipes have even found their way to the dinner table. For instance, Pongal accompanied by Gothsu makes for a wholesome and nutritious dinner. Whatever be your choice, Tamil tiffins are sure to please your palette. \r\n\r\nAccompaniments are an integral part of any traditional tamil tiffin menu. Sambar and chutney goes with idli, vada and dosa. Kurma is usually served with aapam and sevai while adai can be eaten with a simple tomato pickle or lime pickle. The most popular chutney made in Tamil households is the coconut chutney which has freshly grated coconut, chutney dal and fresh green chillies. Pair it up with idli and dosa and your taste buds will be thanking you. I love to try out recipes from various cuisines and accompaniments are no exception. Sometimes I make a Chettinad tomato chutney or a peanut chutney from Andhra cuisine to go with idlis, dosas or even adai. I also make chutneys with vegetables like tindora, zucchini, ridge gourd, etc. as a healthy alternative.\r\n\r\nTamil tiffins are very versatile even if you are on a low carb or low fat diet. Try substituting cracked wheat instead of rice while making pongal. For upma kozhakattai use gritts instead of rice. I recently came upon a recipe for adai with gritts. The vegetable chutneys I mentioned earlier are a great substitute to the traditional coconut chutney. The options are unlimited. \r\n\r\nA write up on Traditional Tamil Tiffins is incomplete without a recipe for the traditional idli, sambar and chutney. Here it goes.\r\n\r\nIdli with coconut chutney and varuthu araicha sambar\r\n\r\nIDLI\r\n\r\nIngredients:\r\nPonni boiled rice - 4 cups (use either Laxmi Brand or Raja Brand)\r\nUrad dal - 1 cup\r\nMethi seeds - 1 tbsp (adjust according to taste)\r\nSalt\r\n\r\n\r\nMethod:\r\n1. Soak the rice and dal in separate bowls for about 3-4 hours. \r\n2. Add the methi seeds either to the dal or rice while soaking. \r\n3. Grind the dal to a smooth consistency. \r\n4. Do not grind the rice into a very smooth paste. Make it a bit coarse. The idlis and dosas will turn out better.\r\n5. Add salt and to the above batter and let ferment overnight or until you see the batter rise up. \r\n6. Pour into idli moulds. Steam 10-12 minutes and serve hot with chutney and sambar. \r\n\r\nAdd water and dilute the batter to make dosas.\r\n\r\nCOCONUT CHUTNEY\r\n\r\nIngredients:\r\nFresh\/frozen grated coconut - 1\/4 cup\r\nChutney dal\/Putana dal - 1\/4 cup\r\nGreen chillies - a few according to taste\r\nAsafoetida - a pinch\r\nSalt to taste\r\n\r\nFor seasoning:\r\nMustard seeds - 1\/2 tsp\r\nUrad dal\/channa dal - 1\/4 tsp\r\nCurry leaves - a few\r\nDry red chilly - 1\r\n\r\nMethod:\r\n1. Put the ingredients in a blender and make a paste. \r\n2. Season with mustard, urad dal, curry leaves and dry red chilli. \r\n3. Add salt to taste. \r\n4. For a thinner consistency add more water while grinding.\r\n\r\n\r\nVARUTHU ARAICHA SAMBAR\r\n\r\nIngredients:\r\nThuvar dal - 1\/2 cup\r\nOnion - 1 (you can use a handful of pearl onions too)\r\nTomato - 1\r\nTamarind extract - 1\/2 cup ( I use 2 tsps of Laxmi brand tamarind concentrate)\r\nTurmeric powder - 1\/4 tsp\r\nFresh coriander - for garnish\r\n\r\nFor the paste:\r\nCoconut - 2 tbps\r\nChanna dal - 1 tsp\r\nDhania\/Coriander seeds - 2 tsp\r\nMethi seeds - 1\/2 tsp\r\nDry red chillies - 5 or 6 (adjust to taste)\r\nAsafoetida \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a pinch\r\n\r\nFor seasoning:\r\nMustard - 1\/2 tsp\r\nCurry leaves\r\nUrad dal - 14 tsp\r\n\r\nMethod:\r\n1. Cook thuvar dal and set aside. \r\n2. Pour oil in a pan and slightly fry the onions until they become soft. Do not burn them. \r\n3. Add the tamarind extract, tomatoes and turmeric powder and boil until the raw smell of the tamarind disappears. The tomatoes will get cooked in this process.\r\n4. Fry the ingredients for the paste with very little oil. Make a paste and add to the tamarind mixture.\r\n5. Let it come together then add the cooked and slightly mashed thuvar dal. \r\n6. Add salt and water if required. Mix well. \r\n7. Season with mustard seeds, urad dal and curry leaves. \r\n8. Garnish with coriander.\r\n\r\nSambar can also be made with vegetables like bell peppers, bottle gourd, butternut squash, etc. For idlis onion sambar is the best.\r\n\r\nThe next recipe is for sevai and kurma. A light snack would be served whenever a groom came to see a prospective bride. And sevai was the most popular and a must-have item on the menu for this occasion. While making sevai from scratch is a laborious process, everyone in the house would pitch in to make this light and fluffy delicacy. Sevai is usually served with potato masala and coconut chutney.  Kurma as an accompaniment to sevai offers an interesting twist to this traditional recipe. \r\n\r\nInstant sevai with Vegetable kurma\r\n\r\nINSTANT SEVAI\r\n\r\nIngredients:\r\nInstant rice vermicelli - 1\/2 packet (I buy it from the Asian store)\r\nMustard - 1 tsp \r\nUrad dal - 1 tsp \r\nChanna dal - 1 tsp \r\nGreen chillies - 1 or 2 (adjust to taste)\r\nCashews - 2 tsp \r\nLemon juice - 2 tsps \r\nTurmeric powder - 1\/2 tsp \r\nA pinch of asafoetida\r\nSalt to taste\r\nOil as needed\r\nA few curry leaves\r\nFresh cilantro for garnish\r\n\r\nMethod:\r\n1. Put a big pot of water to boil. Once the water boils add the instant rice vermicelli. Keep stirring and remove as soon as it is cooked. This takes hardly 3 to 4 minutes. Do not overcook as it will become sticky and lumpy. Drain and spread out on a plate to cool. Add 1 to 2 tsps of oil to prevent the vermicelli from sticking.\r\n2. Pour oil in a pan and add the mustard. Once it splutters add urad dal, channa dal, green chillies and curry leaves. \r\n3. Add the turmeric powder and asafoetida mix well and remove from the flame.\r\n4. Transfer the rice vermicelli to the pan with seasonings and mix well. It is easier to handle the vermicelli with your hands. Keep loosening the vermicelli as you mix into the seasoning. \r\n5. Add salt, lemon juice and cilantro and mix till all are incorporated.\r\n6. Garnish with roasted cashews.\r\n\r\nVEGETABLE KURMA\r\n\r\nIngredients:\r\nVegetables \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 2 cups \u00e2\u20ac\u201c use a combination of carrot, cauliflower, potato, green peas and beans\r\nOnion \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 1 (finely chopped)\r\nTomato \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 1 (finely chopped)\r\nTomato paste \u00e2\u20ac\u201c \u00c2\u00bd tsp\r\nGreen chillies \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 2 or 3\r\nGinger garlic paste \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 1 tsp\r\nRed chilli powder \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 1 tsp\r\nKashmiri chilli powder \u00e2\u20ac\u201c \u00c2\u00bd tsp (for color)\r\nCoriander powder \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 1 tsp\r\nGaram masala powder \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 1 tsp\r\nTurmeric powder \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a pinch\r\nBay leaf \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 1 or 2\r\nSalt to taste\r\n\r\nFor the paste:\r\nCoconut \u00e2\u20ac\u201c \u00c2\u00bc cup\r\nCashewnuts \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a few\r\nPoppy seeds \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 1 tsp\r\nFennel seeds\/saunf \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 1 tsp\r\nGreen chillies \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 2 (optional)\r\n\r\nMethod\r\n1.
