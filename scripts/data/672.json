Mango season is almost through with very few varieties available in the market. I bought a few  mangoes (banganpalli variety) and prepared mango salsa. It would take another 8-9 months before I eat a ripe mango, so mango salsa it was with corn chips.\r\n\r\nA typical summer fare, this mango salsa had a sweet-tangy taste with capsicum providing the crunch and mild spice.
