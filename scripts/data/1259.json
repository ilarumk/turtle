I know a few of you will wince on reading that. I love brinjal cooked in any form! This vibrant purple beauty has always been my favorite since childhood.\r\n\r\nYesterday there was a bit of chill in the air with no sunlight, pretty dull kind of weather that called for a spiced one pot dish like Vangi Bhath aka Brinjal Rice. There are a good number of Vangi Bhath Masala versions based on the region its prepared. Many spices go into the making of Vangi Bath masala and if you think too many spices might overwhelm the rice dish, you are wrong, as each spice lends a unique flavor of this brinjal rice. \r\n\r\nThe recipe I have followed is from Karnataka where cooked rice is accented with brinjals, curry leaves, roasted peanuts and a lot of spices. It's finished with an all-important garnish of roasted peanuts and a dash of lemon juice (this particular recipe has lemon juice as an ingredient). Combined with cooked rice, the fresh taste of roasted brinjals in aromatic spices can be savored as a one pot meal without any sides to accompany it. Equally delicious when eaten with plain yogurt and papad. \r\n\r\nHome grown brinjals\r\n\r\nNext on my to-be-tried list is prepare Vangi Bhath using Goda Masala, the Maharastrian version of brinjal rice\r\n\r\nVaangi Bath Recipe\r\nPrep & Cooking: 30 mts\r\nServes 4-5 persons\r\nCuisine: Karnataka\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIngredients:\r\n\r\n1\/2 kg raw rice (cook rice such that each grain is separate, add a tsp of ghee and lemon juice to the rice and combine)\r\n\r\n1\/4 kg green or purple brinjals (thinly slice into 2\" pieces and place in salted water)\r\n\r\n1 1\/2 tbsps oil\r\n\r\n1 tsp mustard seeds\r\n\r\n1 tsp channa dal (optional)\r\n\r\n15 fresh curry leaves\r\n\r\npinch of turmeric pwd\r\n\r\n2-3 tbsps roasted groundnuts\r\n\r\n1\/2 tbsp lemon juice (optional)\r\n\r\nsalt to taste\r\n\r\n\r\nTo be roasted and ground to a fine pwd:\r\n\r\n3 dry red chillis (adjust to your spice level)\r\n\r\n1 tsp coriander seeds\r\n\r\n1\/4 tsp khus-khus\/gasagasalu\/poppy seeds\r\n\r\nlarge pinch cumin seeds\r\n\r\n1\/2 tbsp black gram dal (minappappu)\r\n\r\n1\/2 tbsp bengal gram\/channa dal\/senaga pappu\r\n\r\n1\/2 tbsp grated dry coconut\r\n\r\n1 Marathi moggu\r\n\r\n1\u00e2\u20ac\u009d cinnamon stick (dalchinichakka)\r\n\r\n1 clove\r\n\r\n1\/4 tbsp sesame seeds\r\n\r\n1\/4 tsp hing\/inguva\/asafoetida\r\n\r\n1 tsp oil\r\n\r\n1 Heat a cooking vessel on medium heat and dry roast cumin seeds and coriander seeds, clove, marathi moggu, cinnamon and dry chillis for 2 mts.
