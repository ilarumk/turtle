Decided to use the left over rice and veggies to prepare an Indo Chinese appetizer. Very easy and quick to bring together and makes for a great evening snack when your kids come home hungry after play. Interesting combination of flavors and textures. Nehal enjoys them with tomato ketchup. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSesame Honey Rice Balls Recipe\r\nPrep & Cooking: 30 mts\r\nCuisine: Indo-Chinese\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\nIngredients:\r\n\r\n1 cup rice, cooked\r\n\r\n3 spring onion whites, finely chopped\r\n\r\n1 cup chopped vegetables  (carrot, beans, capsicum)\r\n\r\n1-2 green chilli finely chopped \r\n\r\n3 garlic cloves,crushed\r\n\r\n1 1\/2 tbsps coriander leaves, chopped\r\n\r\n1 tsp soy sauce\r\n\r\nblack pepper pwd to taste\r\n\r\n2 1\/2 -3 tbsps corn flour\r\n\r\n2 tbsps honey\r\n\r\nsesame seeds for coating\r\n\r\nsalt to taste\r\n\r\noil for deep frying\r\n\r\n1\/2 tbsp oil\r\n\r\nFor flour batter:\r\n\r\n2 tbsps flour\/maida\r\n\r\npinch of salt\r\n\r\nwater to make thin batter\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Heat oil in a vessel, add spring onion whites, crushed garlic and green chilies and saute for 3 mts.
