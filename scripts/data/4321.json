Bought half a kilo.\r\n\r\nDal Palak, Aloo Bhindi and Brown rice ~ Our meal\r\n\r\nI am very fond of North Indian stir fries. Earlier on I had blogged a sukhi (dry) sabzi recipe, Aloo Bhindi, that called for tomatoes. Yesterday, I prepared a slightly different version of Aloo Bhindi sans tomatoes. A nice change from the routine. I enjoyed the stir fry along with Palak Dal and rice. The spices melded beautifully with the potato and okra. Versatile recipe, you can use spices of your choice. Added a few curry leaves for that aromatic touch. \r\n\r\n\r\nSukhi Aloo Bhindi Sabzi Recipe\r\nPrep & Cooking: 40 mts\r\nServes 4-5 persons\r\nCuisine: North Indian\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\nIngredients:\r\n\r\n2 potatoes, peeled and cubed\r\n\r\n150 gms okra, chopped into small pieces\r\n\r\nbig pinch of asafoetida\/hing\/inguvva \r\n\r\n1 tsp red chilli pwd\r\n\r\n1\/4 tsp turmeric pwd\r\n\r\n3\/4 tbsp coriander pwd\r\n\r\n1\/2 tsp saunf pwd\r\n\r\n1\/4 tsp jeera pwd\r\n\r\npinch garam masala pwd (1 cloves, 1\/2\" cinnamon, 1 cardamom)\r\n\r\nsalt to taste\r\n\r\n1-2 tsps lemon juice\r\n\r\nfew curry leaves (optional)\r\n\r\n1 1\/2 tbsps oil \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Heat oil in a vessel, add the asafoetida, coriander pwd, jeera pwd, turmeric pwd, red chilli pwd, saunf pwd and 2 tbsps of water and saute for 10-12 seconds.
