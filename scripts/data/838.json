I have personally benefited from it immensely and had got used to this support system like so many others. When Indira suggested at  Dining Hall that anyone interested could start a similar service, I took the responsibility to work out an efficient system like FBD. Also, comments of fellow bloggers at DH made me realize how important it is to have a good food blog aggregator. My friend and I worked for 3 days to make \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcTaste Of India\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 happen. Taste Of India is on the same lines as FBD except for one or two additional features. I feel extremely happy with this wonderful opportunity that helps me give back to the food blogger fraternity from which I have derived a lot and continue to do so. \r\n\r\nI am hoping all food blog fans and food bloggers will benefit from Taste Of India and we bloggers continue to enjoy exposure, increased readership and most importantly save time, like we did from FBD. We can't thank you enough, Indira and Mathy, for your selfless efforts in bringing this wonderful resource to us.\r\n\r\nThe feeds of almost all the Indian food bloggers that I am aware are up and live at Taste Of India. You can subscribe to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcTaste Of India\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 xml feed [ http:\/\/www.connect.sailusfood.com\/feed ]. Food bloggers whose feeds are yet to be updated at Taste of India, can update their feed address at 'suggest a feed'  and any queries\/comments can be left at this page. \r\n\r\nTaste of India for you! Happy Republic Day and happy surfing!-:)\r\n","image":"http:\/\/www.sailusfood.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/taste_of_india.JPG","image-small":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/taste_of_india-150x150.jpg","image-large":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/taste_of_india-300x300.jpg","author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Misc"],"tags":["blog_aggregator"]}
