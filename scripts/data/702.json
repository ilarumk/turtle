During my growing years, when my grandmother prepared this dish, the aroma which emanated from her kitchen would spread throughout the house, pulling us like magnets towards the dining table much before lunch time.:)\r\n\r\n\r\nMustard flavored stir fries or dishes are a part of Andhra cuisine. Usually cabbage, jackfruit and raw bananas are some of the vegetables\/fruits used in mustard based preparations. The heady aroma, warmth and unique flavor of this traditional Andhra vegetarian delicacy, ava pettina arati koora, is from the pronounced use of mustard. Very quick, simple to prepare, healthy and makes a great side with hot steamed rice or rotis.\r\n\r\n\r\nAva Pettina Arati Kura Recipe\r\nPrep & Cooking: 20 mts\r\nServes: 3-4 \r\nCuisine: Andhra\r\n.\r\n\r\nIngredients:\r\n\r\n2 raw plantains, skinned and cubed \r\n\r\nbig pinch turmeric pwd\r\n\r\n1 1\/2 tsp oil\r\n\r\nsalt to taste\r\n\r\nFor seasoning\/poppu\/tadka:\r\n\r\n1\/2 tsp mustard seeds\r\n\r\n1\/4 tsp split black gram dal\r\n\r\n1 green chillis, slit\r\n\r\n10-12 curry leaves\r\n\r\npinch of asafoetida\/hing\r\n\r\nMake a coarse paste:\r\n\r\n1 1\/2 tsp mustard seeds\r\n\r\n1 green chilli\r\n\r\n1\" ginger\r\n\r\n2-3 tbsps grated coconut\r\n\r\n2 tbsps water\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Add a cup of water to the cubed plantains along with turmeric and salt and cook till soft but not mushy.
