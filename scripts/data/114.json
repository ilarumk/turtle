I learnt this recipe during my college days from one of my numerous North Indian friends who would bring it in her tiffin dabba with rotis. I reminse the days when we would swap our tiffin dabbas and how I'd lap up delicious North Indian fare like stuffed paranthas and chole while my friends would relish our South Indian tiffins like masala dosas, idlis and garellu. I always tried out different combinations of a particular dish(which is new to me) using different spices with recipes like curried baby potatoes and aloo palak and finally settle for one which is suited to my palate in terms of spice and flavor. North Indian cuisine calls for the use of less spice than our Andhra cuisine. If I feel that the flavor of a dish needs to be pepped up a bit in terms of spice then I do make a subtle change without playing too much with the ingredients and cooking style of the authentic original recipe. The end result has never been disappointing so far and I always had my family and friends relish the food served to them..:) \r\n\r\nAloo Tamatar Sabzi is a very simple, everyday dish regularly cooked in many North Indian kitchens. Boiled potatoes are cooked in a spiced gravy of onions and tomatoes and makes a great curry with rotis and chapatis. I also make this sometimes as an accompaniment to a subtly spiced flavored rice or steamed white rice.\r\n\r\n\r\nAloo Tamatar Subzi (Potato-Tomato Curry)\r\n\r\nIngredients:\r\n\r\n4 medium potatoes (boiled and slightly mash with hand roughly to form small chunks)\r\n1 large onion chopped finely\r\n3 cloves garlic finely minced\r\n1\" ginger finely minced\r\n1\/2 tsp mustard seeds\r\n2 dry red chillis\r\n10-12 curry leaves\r\n2 green chilli slit length wise\r\n1 tsp red chilli pwd (adjust according to your choice)\r\n1 tbsp coriander pwd\r\n1\/2 tsp cumin pwd\r\n1\/4 tsp turmeric pwd\r\nsalt to taste\r\n3 medium sized tomatoes finely chopped\r\n1 1\/2 tbsp oil\r\nchopped coriander leaves for garnish\r\n1 tsp jaggery or sugar (optional)\r\n\r\nHeat oil in a cooking vessel and add the mustard seeds and let them pop.
