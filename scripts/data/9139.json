This tindora\/ivy gourd recipe walks away a winner with the minimal of ingredients and a flavor to die for. I love the simplicity of this recipe and how comforting it is to the palate. Amchur or raw mango powder is what gives the tindora a boost of flavor. So, do use amchur if you make this stir fry. And, seriously, you should prepare it. Makes for a good side with roti or rice and dal.\r\n\r\nTindora, Tendli, Dondakaya, Kovakkai, Ivy Gourd\r\n\r\n\r\nTindora Sabzi Recipe\r\nPrep: 40-45 mts\r\nServes: 3-4 persons\r\n.\r\n\r\nIngredients:\r\n\r\n\r\n250 gms \/1\/4 kg Dondakayalu\/Tendli\/Ivy Gourds\r\n\r\n1 tsp cumin seeds\r\n\r\npinch of asafoetida\/hing\/inguva\r\n\r\n2-3 dry chillis, tear OR 1\/2 tsp red chilli pwd\r\n\r\npinch of turmeric pwd\r\n\r\n1\/2 tsp amchur pwd or 1\/2 tbsp lemon juice\r\n\r\npinch of garam masala pwd (cloves, caradamom, cinnamon)\r\n\r\nsalt to taste\r\n\r\n1 1\/2 tbsps oil\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Wash the tindora and nip the tip and tail ends. Slit each ivy gourd into two, length wise and slice them into thin long strips. \r\n2 Heat oil in a cooking vessel. Once the oil is hot, reduce heat to medium flame, add the cumin seeds and let them splutter and turn brown. Add hing and dry red chillis and fry for a few seconds till the aroma emanates the kitchen. \r\n3 Immediately add the sliced tindora and combine. Add salt and turmeric pwd and mix well. Saute on medium heat for 3-4 minutes, keep sauteing so that it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t burn. Now reduce to low flame, place lid, let it cook, approx 15-18 minutes. Keep checking in between, sauteing them so that they don't burn. The sauteed tindora will lose moisture and begin to have a wrinkled appearance. \r\n4 Remove lid, and cook on low-medium flame for another 20-25 mts. The tindora should retain that, slight crunchy texture. Add amchur pwd and garam masala and combine. Turn off heat.\r\n5 Finally, adjust the salt and serve hot with steamed rice.","image":"http:\/\/www.sailusfood.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/05\/tindora-sabji.jpg","image-small":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/tindora-sabji-150x150.jpg","image-large":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/tindora-sabji-300x300.jpg","style":["easy","modern","quick"],"course":["side"],"special-diet":["nut free","eggless","vegetarian","vegan","kid friendly","pregnancy","dairy free"],"cuisine":["north indian"],"cook-time":"35","prep-time":"10","main-ingredient":["tindora","ivy gourd"],"goes-well-with":["rice","roti"],"author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Indian Fry Recipes","Indian Vegan Recipes","Indian Vegetarian Recipes","North Indian Recipes","Recipes Vegetable Dishes"],"tags":["ivy-gourds","sabji","stir-fry","tindora"]}
