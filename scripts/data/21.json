Grease the griddle with peanut oil or any other oil. Pour one ladle full of batter over the griddle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpread the batter from the bottom of the ladle evenly making circles. Drizzle oil or butter around the edges of dosa and let it cook on medium heat. The dosa should turn light brown. The dosa generally takes 4-5 minutes to cook on medium heat. Take care not to burn it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpread some butter over the dosa and then spread potato curry filling in the center of the dosa and fold it towards the center such that it covers the potato curry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSimilarly fold the other side also such that it covers the potato curry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMasala dosa is ready to eat. Masala Dosas can also be served with any chutney, podi or sambar. It is best to eat the dosa the moment its off the griddle..hot. I have tried to take some amateur pictures of the dosa batter spreading on the griddle....but hey, it tastes good and that's what matters:):)","image":"http:\/\/www.sailusfood.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/masala_dosa_curry.jpg","image-small":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/masala_dosa_curry-150x150.jpg","image-large":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/masala_dosa_curry-300x300.jpg","style":["easy","traditional"],"course":["meal","lunch box"],"special-diet":["eggless","nut free","dairy free","vegetarian","vegan","kid friendly","gluten\/wheat free"],"cuisine":["indian","south indian"],"cook-time":"30","prep-time":"15","main-ingredient":["rice","urad dal","potato"],"serves":"6","goes-well-with":["chutney","podi","sambar","potato curry"],"author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Chaat Recipes","Indian Breakfast Recipes","Indian Dal Recipes","Indian Vegetarian Recipes","Recipes Vegetable Dishes","South Indian Recipes"],"tags":["dosa","dosa-batter","dosa-filling","masala dosa","potato curry"]}
