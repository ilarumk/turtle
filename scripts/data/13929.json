Very few and simple ingredients go into the making of this healthy sandwich recipe. This sandwich filling incorporates blanched and chopped spinach, onions, garlic, garam masala powder, black pepper and low fat cheese (can be replaced with paneer). Nehal enjoyed it so much that he asked me to make this sandwich again as an evening after school snack.  \r\n\r\nWith the left over spinach filling, I made a quick sandwich for myself this morning. I spread some Middle eastern classic dip, hummus, on a brown bread slice, layered with spinach filling, grated paneer and lightly toasted the bread. It made for a delightfully delicious sandwich. Well, the variations are endless. Just go make yourself this sandwich. You will love it. :)\r\n\r\nBrown Bread Sandwich","image":"http:\/\/www.sailusfood.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/06\/spinach-sandwich.jpg","image-small":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/spinach-sandwich-150x150.jpg","image-large":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/spinach-sandwich-300x300.jpg","style":["easy","quick","modern"],"course":["snack"],"special-diet":["eggless","nut free","vegetarian","vegan","kid friendly","pregnancy"],"cuisine":["Western"],"cook-time":"5","prep-time":"7","main-ingredient":["spinach","brown bread"],"serves":"2","goes-well-with":["Tomato Sauce"],"author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Lunch Box Recipes","Recipes Vegetable Dishes"],"tags":["sandwich","spinach"]}
