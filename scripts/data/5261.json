Now, my goal is to eat raw once a week and be consistent. :)\r\n\r\nPineapple, Paneer & Vegetable Salad\r\n\r\nBring together 1\/4 cup of boiled kidney beans (rajma), 1\/2 cup cubed paneer (sauteed in a tsp of olive oil), 1 small chopped onion, 1 small chopped cucumber, 1 small chopped capsicum, 1 chopped tomato, 1 1\/2 cups chopped pineapple, peeled orange segments, 1\/4 cup sprouts of your choice, tbsp of chopped coriander leaves, tablespoon of honey, salt and pepper to taste.
