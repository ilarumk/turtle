Dear readers, I have for you Oats Bisibelebath, a Karnataka classic rice, lentil and vegetable dish where the rice has been substituted with oats. A wholesome, one pot meal with all the nutritious goodness going into it in the form of oats, protein rich dal, mixed vegetables and warming spices.\r\n\r\nRoasted spices to make Bisi Bela Bath powder\r\n\r\nThe key to this oats recipe is the spice blend aka bisi bela bath powder. There are variations to this spice powder and I have tried to stay close to the authentic bisi bela bath spice mix. It works for me and I am hoping you will like it as well. :)\r\n\r\nOats Bisi Bela Bath","image":"http:\/\/www.sailusfood.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/09\/oats-bisi-bela-bath.jpg","image-small":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/oats-bisi-bela-bath-150x150.jpg","image-large":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/oats-bisi-bela-bath-300x300.jpg","style":["easy","quick","modern"],"course":["breakfast"],"special-diet":["eggless","dairy free","nut free","gluten free","vegetarian","vegan","kid friendly","pregnancy"],"cuisine":["south indian"],"cook-time":"20","prep-time":"20","main-ingredient":["oats","vegetables","tur dal"],"serves":"4","goes-well-with":["yogurt"],"author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Indian Breakfast Recipes","Lunch Box Recipes","Recipes Vegetable Dishes"],"tags":["bisi-bele-bath","bisibelabath","indian-recipes-with-oats","oats"]}
