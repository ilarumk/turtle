Sweet Potato is a favorite in our home. The irregular shaped, oblong tuber also known as Teepi Dumpa in coastal parts of Andhra is usually available through out the year in the farmer's market. Most times we like to eat them steamed or make a mixed vegetable curry (Kalagaya Kura). Other than making a curry we also make a tangy stew using sweet potato that is popular in most parts of Andhra. \r\n\r\nSweet potato is simmered in a beautiful amalgamation of spices like fenugreek, cumin, coriander, chilis, jaggery and tamarind extract to yield a soft, creamy, melt in the mouth texture with a burst of sweet and tangy flavors. The flavorful stew with warm rice makes for a delectable, comforting meal.","image":"http:\/\/www.sailusfood.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/sweet-potato-indian-recipes.jpg","image-small":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/sweet-potato-indian-recipes-150x150.jpg","image-large":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/sweet-potato-indian-recipes-300x300.jpg","style":["easy","traditional"],"course":["side"],"special-diet":["eggless","nut free","dairy free","gluten free","vegan","vegetarian","kid friendly","pregnancy"],"cuisine":["andhra"],"cook-time":"40","prep-time":"10","main-ingredient":["sweet potato","tamarind"],"serves":"4","goes-well-with":["rice"],"author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Andhra Recipes","Indian Vegan Recipes","Indian Vegetarian Recipes","Recipes Vegetable Dishes","South Indian Recipes"],"tags":["chilakada dumpa","pulusu","stew","sweet potato"]}
