I have received several requests to post a perfectly light, fluffy bhatura recipe. I have already posted one and I have since tried to perfect the recipe of bhatura. It is almost close to what I have tasted at my Punjabi friend's home many years ago.\r\n\r\nAn indulgent street food fare, Bhatura is gem among Punjabi vegetarian recipes and is popular all over India. The sight of the puffed fried bread with an aromatic tangy flavored chickpea curry aka chole is hard to resist even to the diet conscious. Bhatura has a crisp exterior and spongy interior with a mild sour flavor. An absolutely easy to make recipe that has no yeast in its making while yogurt and baking powder are essential. Serve bhatura with chole, sweetened yogurt\/dahi that is lightly sprinkled with chaat masala, roasted cumin powder and red chili powder. Chole Bhature has all the essentials of a great brunch, its filling, decadent and makes for a complete meal.\r\n\r\nBhature","image":"http:\/\/www.sailusfood.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/bhatura-recipe.jpg","image-small":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/bhatura-recipe-150x150.jpg","image-large":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/bhatura-recipe-300x300.jpg","cook-time":"20","prep-time":"20","main-ingredient":["flour","curd"],"serves":"7","author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Flour Recipes","Indian Bread Recipes","Indian Breakfast Recipes","Indian Vegetarian Recipes","North Indian Recipes"],"tags":["bhatura","punjabi recipes"]}
