It was a common sight to find road side vendors selling a snack prepared with puffed rice, Uggani with Mirchi Bajji, a typical combination found only in this region. \r\n\r\nA very basic and simple recipe that has roasted chickpeas and dry coconut as its star players. Each home has its own version, some use tomatoes, a few throw in peanuts for the crunch factor and many omit dry coconut. Whatever the version, Uggani, is a light yet filling dish that is relished by the Rayalaseema folks. I like to make it as an evening snack along side mirchi bajji (green chili fritters) and masala chai on a rainy day. When you have unexpected guests drop by and need to whip up a quick snack, make Uggani and serve it with a cup of hot kadak chai and papad or chips. I would categorize Uggani as one of the simplest yet flavorful snack among South Indian recipes. \r\n\r\noorugula Upma ~ Rayalaseema Special","image":"http:\/\/www.sailusfood.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/07\/borugula-upma.jpg","image-small":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/borugula-upma-150x150.jpg","image-large":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/borugula-upma-300x300.jpg","style":["easy","quick","traditional"],"course":["breakfast"],"special-diet":["eggless","gluten free","vegetarian","vegan","kid friendly","pregnancy"],"cuisine":["andhra"],"cook-time":"7","prep-time":"10","main-ingredient":["puffed rice"],"serves":"4","goes-well-with":["mirchi bajji"],"author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Andhra Recipes","Indian Breakfast Recipes","Indian Snacks and Starter Recipes","Indian Vegan Recipes","Indian Vegetarian Recipes","South Indian Recipes"],"tags":["puffed-rice","snack","uggani"]}
