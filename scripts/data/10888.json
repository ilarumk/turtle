Prepared a simple and quick salad with Iceberg lettuce, red and yellow capsicums and cucumber. I used balsamic-honey vinaigrette which is simple yet assertive. \r\n\r\nWash, pat dry a head of iceberg lettuce and tear into bite sized pieces, slice a cucumber, dice half a red bell pepper and yellow bell pepper. For salad dressing, whisk 1 tbsp balsamic vinegar, 1 1\/2 tbsps olive oil, crushed small garlic clove, 1 tsp mustard sauce, salt to taste, 1\/4 tsp pepper powder and 2 tsps of honey. Pour this dressing over the raw vegetables and toss well. Refrigerate until use. Finish with a sprinkling of toasted sesame seeds or nuts of your choice.","image":"http:\/\/www.sailusfood.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/11\/lettuce-salad-balsamic-vinaigrette.jpg","image-small":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/lettuce-salad-balsamic-vinaigrette-150x150.jpg","image-large":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/lettuce-salad-balsamic-vinaigrette-300x300.jpg","style":["easy","quick","modern"],"course":["salad"],"special-diet":["eggless","dairy free","vegetarian","vegan","kid friendly","gluten free","pregnancy"],"cuisine":["western"],"prep-time":"15","main-ingredient":["iceberg lettuce","capsicum","balsamic vinegar"],"serves":"2","author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Indian Vegan Recipes","Indian Vegetarian Recipes","Raw Food Recipes","Recipes Vegetable Dishes","Salad Recipes"],"tags":["balsamic","lettuce","raw-food","vinaigrette"]}
