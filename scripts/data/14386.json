News of an early monsoon is like music to the ears. :) Last week, we went for a pot luck dinner for which I made a vegetarian dish using raw banana (plantain). Though I cook raw banana recipes often, I realised that only few of them have made to the blog. Raw Banana Kofta aka Kela Kofta is a classic among North Indian vegetarian recipes usually served on special occasions. Though its a labor intensive dish its worth the time and effort due to its great flavor. The dumplings (raw banana kofta) can be served as an appetizer or can be simmered in a rich gravy and served as a main course dish. \r\n\r\nThe warming gravy aka sauce adds that magic touch which pulls the dish together and makes for an excellent side with flavored rice or rotis. Serve the raw banana kofta curry with pulao and you have a special meal on hand.\r\n\r\nKela Kofta\r\n\r\n","image":"http:\/\/www.sailusfood.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/05\/raw-banana-kofta-curry.jpg","image-small":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/raw-banana-kofta-curry-150x150.jpg","image-large":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/raw-banana-kofta-curry-300x300.jpg","style":["easy","traditional"],"course":["main-course"],"special-diet":["eggless","gluten free","vegetarian","kid friendly","pregnancy"],"cuisine":["north indian"],"cook-time":"45","prep-time":"30","main-ingredient":["raw banana"],"serves":"4","goes-well-with":["pulao"],"author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Indian Curry Recipes","Indian Vegetarian Recipes","North Indian Recipes","Recipes Vegetable Dishes"],"tags":["kofta","raw banana","raw-plantain"]}
