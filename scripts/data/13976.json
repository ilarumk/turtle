Well, I have another paneer sandwich recipe for you which is a favorite in our home. We LOVE it! It is not much of a recipe but then 'less is more' is the concept going on here. And I must mention that not only is it healthy, its simply delicious and will have you craving for more. :) \r\n\r\nThe next time around, I will add caramelized onions, roasted capsicum and toasted pumpkin seeds for some crunch. You can go with endless add-ins including left overs while making a quick sandwich. If you do not have paneer on hand, use hung yogurt which makes for a lovely spread over sandwiches. Use whole wheat bread or brown bread. Paneer Sandwich can be served as an open faced sandwich too.\r\n\r\nHealthy Sandwich Recipe for Kids\r\n\r\nMore Sandwich Recipes \r\nSpiced Kidney Beans Sandwich Recipe\r\nPotato Egg Sandwich\r\nSpinach Sandwich Recipe\r\nVegetable Sandwich Recipe\r\nEgg Salad Sandwich Recipe\r\nDouble Layer Vegetable Sandwich Recipe\r\nVegetable Cheese Sandwich with Caramelized Onions Recipe","image":"http:\/\/www.sailusfood.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/08\/paneer-sandwich.jpg","image-small":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/paneer-sandwich-150x150.jpg","image-large":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/paneer-sandwich-300x300.jpg","style":["easy","quick","modern"],"course":["breakfast"],"special-diet":["eggless","nut free","vegetarian","kid friendly","pregnancy"],"cuisine":["Indian"],"cook-time":"5","prep-time":"10","main-ingredient":["paneer","bread"],"serves":"2","goes-well-with":["juice","tea","coffee"],"author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Indian Breakfast Recipes","Indian Paneer Recipes","Indian Snacks and Starter Recipes","Indian Vegetarian Recipes","Lunch Box Recipes"],"tags":["healthy-recipe","paneer","paneer-sandwich","sandwich"]}
