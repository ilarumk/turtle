He is extremely fond of kheema curry that I prepare and had requested for it. This kheema curry that I am featuring today is a standard one but what makes a huge difference in flavor is the home ground masala powder that goes into its making. It amazes me how a simple combination of basic, on-hand spices can yield such delectable results. Perfect blend of flavor and spice! And any left overs makes a great filling for a kheema sandwich.\r\n\r\nDo you have a favorite minced meat curry recipe?
