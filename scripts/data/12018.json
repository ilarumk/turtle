Few days ago I prepared a no bake chocolate biscuit cake and it was all gone within a few hours. Not much of a recipe. Just four ingredients - biscuits, butter, golden syrup and chocolate go into its making. Digestive biscuits work best but you can use Britannia Marie biscuits too. Golden syrup can be substituted with honey. Go ahead and add some chopped nuts and dried fruits to add to the richness. This cold cake is something you'd want to make again and again. :)\r\n\r\nNo Bake Chocolate Biscuit Cake\r\n\r\n\r\nNo Bake Chocolate Biscuit Cake Recipe\r\nPreparation: 10 mts, Setting: 2-3 hours\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\nIngredients:\r\n\r\n10 digestive biscuits or Marie biscuits\r\n\r\n150 gms chopped chocolate\r\n\r\n1 tbsp golden syrup or honey\r\n\r\n1 1\/2 tbsps butter\r\n\r\n2-3 drops vanilla essence (optional)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Lightly grease a square baking pan and line with butter paper.\r\n2 Break the biscuits into small pieces.
