I have mentioned that in one of my earlier posts as well. I keep trying various podi recipes that have their origins in different regions of South India. One such podi that is aromatic with a unique flavor is Milagai Podi. The secret ingredient here is roasted sesame seeds. Sprinkle some of this magic spice powder over dosas or idlis along with a generous drizzle of gingelly oil or ghee and you are assured of a trip to heaven. :)\r\n\r\n\r\nMilagai Podi Recipe\r\nPreparation: 20 minutes\r\nCuisine: South Indian\r\n.\r\n\r\nIngredients:\r\n\r\n\r\n1 1\/2 tsps oil\/ghee for roasting the dals and spices\r\n\r\n1 cup bengal gram dal\/senaga pappu\r\n\r\n1\/2 cup black gram dal\/minappapu\r\n\r\n1\/2 tbsp black pepper corns\r\n\r\n12 dried red chillies\r\n\r\n2 tbsps sesame seeds, dry roast for 3 mts\r\n\r\nfistful of peanuts, dry roast for 5-6 mts (optional)\r\n\r\n1\/2 tsp hing\/asafoetida\/inguva\r\n\r\nsalt to taste\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Drizzle oil in a heavy bottomed vessel and roast the channa dal on low to medium heat for 4 mts.
