A traditional, classic Christmas cookie recipe that is one of the simplest and best cookie I made this Christmas. I adapted this recipe from Joy of Baking website. The shortbread cookies were not too sweet, had a buttery aftertaste and absolutely melt in the mouth. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor soft cookies, roll them slightly thicker. For a crisp cookie, roll them thin and lower the baking temperature. Well, there are endless possibilities\/flavors you can work around the  basic shortbread cookie. You can flavor the shortbread cookies with lemon zest, vanilla, saffron, cardamom, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves or herbs like rosemary. Nehal loves shortbread cookies that are dunked in chocolate and I like them plain with my evening cup of masala chai. \r\n","image":"http:\/\/www.sailusfood.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/12\/short-bread-cookies.jpg","image-small":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/short-bread-cookies-150x150.jpg","image-large":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/short-bread-cookies-300x300.jpg","style":["easy","traditional"],"course":["dessert"],"special-diet":["eggless","nut free","dairy","vegetarian","kid friendly","pregnancy"],"cuisine":["western"],"cook-time":"10","prep-time":"30","main-ingredient":["butter","flour"],"serves":"20","goes-well-with":["milk"],"author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Cookie Recipes","Eggless Cake &amp; Cookie Recipes","Eggless Dessert Recipes","Festival Foods","Sweet Dessert Recipes"],"tags":["cookies","eggless_cookies","shortbread-cookies"]}
