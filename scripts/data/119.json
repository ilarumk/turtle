I have been looking for new recipes using mangoes,away from the monotony and I found one dessert recipe,Aam Ki Kheer,which is new to me that I had tasted at my friend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s place recently.\r\n\r\nIn the South we call kheer as payasam and this creamy fruity dessert is prepared on the same lines we follow to prepare payasam\/kheer and is pretty simple. I have been wanting to try it ever since I tasted it and today I finally got down to preparing and also present it for JFI \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Mango Event (Jihva For Ingredients) started and hosted by the lovely Indira of Mahanandi.\r\n\r\nI followed my friends\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recipe except for making some changes to make it a low fat mango dessert , by reducing the sugar quantity and substituting the whole milk and condensed milk with low fat milk. I also added a few pieces of ripe mangoes to the payasam for variety, for the feel of that natural fruity sweetness and to intensify the mango flavor.\r\n\r\nIts simple heavenly, the feel of biting into the mango pieces in between the creamy smoothness of the payasam. This dessert is best made not too sweet or rich, taking care not to overpower the flavor of the mango and to allow the natural flavor of the ripe fragrant mango to come through.\r\n\r\nAam ki kheer which is served cold, is prepared by swirling in ripe mango puree or pulp into a mixture of sweetened thickened milk in which rice has been simmered till soft and garnished with cashewnuts and kismis giving it a wonderfully fruity flavour.\r\nMamidipandu Payasam (Aam Ki Kheer)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIngredients: \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 cup ripe mango puree\r\nfew mango pieces for garnish\r\n\u00c2\u00bd lt milk (I used low fat)\r\n1\/3 rd cup rice\r\n4-5 tbsps sugar\r\npinch of salt\r\n1 tbsp ghee\r\n7-8 cashewnuts\r\n10-12 kismis\r\n\u00c2\u00bd tsp cardamom pwd\r\n\r\nSoak rice in water for 15 mts. Bring milk to a boil in a non-stick saucepan.Drain water from the rice and add to the boiling milk.Reduce heat and let the rice cook,stirring continuously till the rice is soft.\r\n\r\nNow add the sugar and go on stirring till the mixture thickens.Remove from heat and cool.\r\n\r\nFry the kismis and cashewnuts in a tbsp of ghee till light brown and combine with the cooked rice.\r\n\r\nSwirl in the mango puree,salt and cardamom pwd.Garnish with cashewnuts, kismis and mango pieces.Serve chilled.\r\n\r\nThe original recipe called for the use of whole milk,1\/2 cup of condensed milk,1\/2 cup of sugar ,mango essence (3-4 drops),pinch of saffron and almonds.\r\n\r\nA great melt-in-the-mouth summer treat with mango flavor, along with the creamy texture produced by sweetened cardamom flavored rice , makes this fruity dessert pure comfort food!
