Nothing like a creamy, fragrant, warm bowl of Pongali especially during winters. There is something unique about the blending of earthy lentils with starchy creaminess of rice. Its pure comfort food.\r\n\r\nClarified butter aka ghee is essential for tempering and I never skimp on black pepper corns. Its super quick to bring together with few spices going into it. Here's Katte Pongali recipe for you as Navratri special festival food.
