I got this capsicum rice recipe from one of our pot-luck party friends and I tweaked the recipe a bit to add more spice and crunch to it. Fresh crunchy capsicums, masala flavor and crunchy peanuts jazz up the taste of the rice dish and make this recipe a real winner!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\nThis rice dish is made by combining cooked rice in a roasted spice blend of cinnamon,red chillis,black gram,cumin,roasted peanuts and coriander seeds in ghee, infused with seasoning of mustard seeds, aromatic curry leaves and capsicums and garnished with roasted peanuts.
