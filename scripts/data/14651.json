Learning how to cook Gobi is essential to truly relish its distinctive taste and texture. Almost all my cooking of gobi recipes involves dunking the gobi in salted hot water for at least 15 minutes before sauteing it till it forms a golden crust. Honestly, this process of blanching and sauteing does make a big difference in the overall flavor of the gobi dish I am making. The gobi dish I am talking about today is Gobi Masala with North Indian flavors. I have added matar aka fresh green peas as I love the combination of gobi and matar and would like to utilize winter vegetables to the fullest when in season. :) I served this flavorful vegetable curry with rotis along side Amritsari dal, yogurt and salad which made for a complete North Indian style meal.\r\n","image":"http:\/\/www.sailusfood.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/11\/gobi-recipes.jpg","image-small":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/gobi-recipes-150x150.jpg","image-large":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/gobi-recipes-300x300.jpg","style":["easy","quick","modern"],"course":["side"],"special-diet":["eggless","gluten free","vegetarian","kid friendly","pregnancy"],"cuisine":["north indian"],"cook-time":"45","prep-time":"15","main-ingredient":["gobi","tomato"],"serves":"4","goes-well-with":["roti"],"author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Indian Curry Recipes","Indian Vegan Recipes","Indian Vegetarian Recipes","North Indian Recipes","Recipes Vegetable Dishes"],"tags":["curry","easy-vegetarian-recipes","gobi","vegetables"]}
