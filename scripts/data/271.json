They are best suited to prepare curries which have a predominately sweet flavor. \r\nIt would be a whole year before I prepare Mamidikaya kura again, during the next mango season, so made this curry for lunch today. A simple, straightforward mango curry recipe using onions, tomatoes, chilli powder, jaggery and tempered with cumin and fenugreek seeds. \r\n\r\nMamidikaya Kura Recipe\r\nRecipe source: From my recipe files\r\nPrep & Cooking: 40 mts \r\nServes 6 persons\r\nCuisine: Andhra\r\n.\r\n\r\nIngredients:\r\n1 raw mango, chopped into pieces along with skin \u00e2\u20ac\u201c preferably thotapuri or bainganpalli variety\r\n\r\n2 tbsp oil\r\n\r\n1 tsp mustard seeds\r\n\r\n\u00c2\u00bd tsp methi (fenugreek seeds)\r\n\r\n\u00c2\u00bd tsp cumin seeds\r\n\r\n10-12 crushed garlic flakes\r\n\r\n2 big onions finely chopped\r\n\r\n2 tomatoes finely chopped\r\n\r\nsalt to taste\r\n\r\n\u00c2\u00bc tsp turmeric pwd\r\n\r\n1 tsp red chilli pwd\r\n\r\n3 cups of water\r\n\r\n\u00c2\u00bd cup grated jaggery\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Pre-heat oil in a heavy bottomed vessel.
