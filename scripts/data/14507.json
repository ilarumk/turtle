It is one those easy dessert recipes prepared with sponge cake. Swiss rolls are part of most Indian bakeries and a favorite among kids and adults alike. Nehal is very fond of jam filled swiss rolls and he asked me to bake them for his school snack. It is basically a sponge cake filled with a delicate layer of jam or any creamy filling like chocolate or strawberry buttercream or whipped cream. You can use any filling of your choice, even nutella and ganache.\r\n\r\nI adapted the recipe from Sprinkle Bakes baking blog and Heather has included a cool video on how to bake, fill and roll the cake. Do watch it before you start making the swiss roll. Just follow the instructions to the T and you will have a pretty swiss roll in minutes. :)\r\n\r\nSwiss Roll with Jam","image":"http:\/\/www.sailusfood.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/swiss-roll.jpg","image-small":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/swiss-roll-150x150.jpg","image-large":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/swiss-roll-300x300.jpg","style":["easy","modern"],"course":["dessert"],"special-diet":["egg","nut free","dairy","kid friendly","pregnancy"],"cuisine":["western"],"cook-time":"15","prep-time":"15","main-ingredient":["flour","eggs","jam"],"serves":"8","author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Cake Recipes","Flour Recipes","Sweet Dessert Recipes"],"tags":["cake","swiss roll"]}
