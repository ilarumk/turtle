I have been travelling quite a bit this past month and that has kept me away from my kitchen..:). Hopefully things should stabilize soon and I should be able to get back to blogging regularly. \r\n\r\nToday I am sharing with you a new recipe, Kaccha Kheema Kofta, I learnt from one of my friends during a recent visit to Hyderabad. Hyderabadi cuisine is a rich cuisine, a blend of royal Mughlai flavors passed down from the renowned chefs of the royal families or Nizams of Hyderabad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKaccha Kheema Kofta curry is prepared with minced meat or kheema that is blended with herbs like coriander and fresh mint leaves, Indian spices and made into small lemon sized balls which are cooked in a paste of fried onions, poppy seeds and dried coconut. \r\n\r\nThe flavor of the kheema koftas which have been cooked in this gravy is different from the usual kofta curries and not high in calories as the koftas are not deep fried. This curry is definitely going to be on the menu for any future get-togethers at home. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKaccha Kheema Kofta Curry\r\nRecipe source: My friend S\r\nPrep & Cooking: 1 hr \r\nServes 5-6 persons \r\nCuisine: Hyderabadi\r\n.\r\n\r\nIngredients:\r\n\r\n250 gms minced meat  (kheema)\r\n\r\n2 tsps ginger garlic paste\r\n\r\n3 green chillis chopped finely\r\n\r\n1 bunch fresh coriander leaves\r\n\r\n2 tbsp fresh mint leaves\r\n\r\n\u00c2\u00bd tsp turmeric pwd\r\n\r\n1 tbsp red chilli pwd\r\n\r\n2 1\/2 tbsps oil\r\n\r\n2 tbsps grated dry coconut\r\n\r\n2 \u00c2\u00bd  tbsps poppy seeds\r\n\r\n2 onions finely sliced\r\n\r\n4 tbsps curds\r\n\r\n1 tsp garam masala pwd\r\n\r\nsalt to taste\r\n\r\n\r\n1 To prepare the koftas, first clean meat in cold running water and drain well.
