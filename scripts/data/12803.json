He is ever hungry during exam time. Does it happen with your kids too? \r\n\r\nI had bookmarked a recipe for chicken stuffed buns quite some time ago but re-discovered it recently and got down to baking them over the weekend. An absolute winner of a recipe from Ria's mother, Mrs. Susy Mathew, who runs a food catering business. Thank you, Ria for sharing your mother's stuffed buns recipe. These buns have become a hit not only with my family but friends and neighbors too. \r\n\r\nBuns proving before baking\r\n\r\nThese stuffed buns have a light and airy texture and are perfect homemade snacks for kids. They work great for breakfast, as a lunch box snack or an after school snack. The filling is absolutely versatile. You can go the vegetarian way with the likes of paneer and mixed vegetables.\r\n\r\nChicken Stuffed Buns","image":"http:\/\/www.sailusfood.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/02\/chicken-stuffed-bun.jpg","image-small":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/chicken-stuffed-bun-150x150.jpg","image-large":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/chicken-stuffed-bun-300x300.jpg","style":["easy","modern"],"course":["snack"],"special-diet":["egg","dairy","gluten","kid friendly","non vegetarian","pregnancy"],"cuisine":["Indian"],"cook-time":"10","prep-time":"90","main-ingredient":["Chicken","All Purpose Flour"],"serves":"12","goes-well-with":["milk"],"author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Flour Recipes","Indian Chicken Recipes","Indian Snacks and Starter Recipes","Lunch Box Recipes"],"tags":["buns","chicken-buns","stuffed-buns"]}
