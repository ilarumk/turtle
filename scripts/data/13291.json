Last week saw the making of a lot of tomato based recipes namely, tomato pickle, tomato rasam, tomato soup and Tamatar Pulao. Tomato Pulao is an extremely flavorful rice dish using ripe red tomatoes and rice. The key to this recipe is in the spices and the use of mint leaves. With raita as an accompaniment, it makes for a great one pot meal. I made coconut chicken curry along with Tamatar pulao which made for a delectable combination.\r\n\r\nTomato Rice\r\n\r\nTamatar Pulao Recipe","image":"http:\/\/www.sailusfood.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/12\/tomato-pulao-recipe.jpg","image-small":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/tomato-pulao-recipe-150x150.jpg","image-large":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/tomato-pulao-recipe-300x300.jpg","style":["easy","quick","modern"],"course":["main-course"],"special-diet":["eggless","dairy free","nut free","gluten free","vegan","vegetarian","kid friendly","pregnancy"],"cuisine":["North Indian"],"cook-time":"30","prep-time":"10","main-ingredient":["Tomato","Rice"],"serves":"4","goes-well-with":["Raita","Chicken Curry","Yogurt"],"author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Indian Rice recipes","Indian Vegan Recipes","Indian Vegetarian Recipes","Lunch Box Recipes","North Indian Recipes","Recipes Vegetable Dishes"],"tags":["pulao","rice","tamatar-pulao","tomato"]}
