I use them a lot in my regular cooking and today's vegan recipe has shallots as the star ingredient. You cannot make this recipe with the regular white or yellow onions. \r\n\r\nThe combination of tamarind, spices and jaggery meld with the shallots to yield an amalgam of flavors that are addictive making you want to eat more and more. Seriously. Eat it with rice, brown rice, roti or dosa, you will love it.\r\n\r\nUllipaya Pulusu ~ Tangy Shallot Stew\r\n\r\nUllipaya Pulusu Recipe\r\nRecipe source: Amma\r\nPrep & Cooking: 35-40 mts\r\nServes 4-5 persons\r\nCuisine: Andhra\r\n.\r\n\r\nIngredients:\r\n\r\n25-30 small sambar onions (or shallots)\r\n\r\n1 tsp ginger garlic paste\r\n\r\npinch of turmeric\r\n\r\n1 tsp red chili powder\r\n\r\n3\/4 tsp coriander powder\r\n\r\n1\/4 tsp roasted cumin powder\r\n\r\nlarge pinch roasted methi powder \r\n\r\n1 medium lemon sized tamarind (extract the juice in 1 cup water)\r\n\r\n1\/2 tbsp jaggery or sugar \r\n\r\nsalt to taste\r\n\r\n1 heaped tsp besan\/chickpea flour\/senagapindi mixed in 2 tbsps water (for thickening the stew)\r\n\r\nfresh coriander leaves for garnish\r\n\r\nFor tempering\/poppu\/tadka:\r\n\r\n1 1\/2 tbsps oil\r\n\r\n1\/2 tsp mustard seeds\r\n\r\n1\/2 tsp cumin seeds\r\n\r\npinch of fenugreek seeds\/menthulu\/methi\r\n\r\n1 dry red chilli \r\n\r\n10-12 fresh curry leaves\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Heat oil in a heavy bottomed vessel, add the mustard seeds and let them jump around.
