Let's raise a toast to good times. Wishing all my dear readers and friends a blessed and peaceful 2011. \r\n\r\nPast few days I baked loads of cookies and cakes. Brazilian Coffee Cookies being one them. All you coffee lovers will swear by them. I followed Rosa's recipe and they came out perfect.\r\n\r\n\r\nBrazilian Coffee Cookies Recipe\r\nPreparation: 10 mts, Baking: 12 mts\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\nIngredients:\r\n\r\n2 cups plain white flour\r\n\r\n1\/2 tsp salt\r\n\r\n1\/4 tsp baking soda\r\n\r\n1\/4 tsp baking powder\r\n\r\n1\/3 cup butter\r\n\r\n1\/2 cup brown sugar\r\n\r\n1\/2 cup white sugar\r\n\r\n1 egg \r\n\r\n1 1\/2 tsp vanilla essence\r\n\r\n1 tbsp milk\r\n\r\n1 tbsp hot water\r\n\r\n2 1\/2 tbsps instant coffee powder\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Sieve together flour, baking pwd, baking soda and salt. Keep aside. \r\n2 Add hot water to the coffee pwd and keep aside.\r\n3 In a bowl, cream together butter, brown sugar and white sugar until well blended. Beat in the milk, vanilla essence and egg until light and creamy. Add the coffee mixture and mix.\r\n4 Mix in the sieved ingredients until just blended. Cover with plastic foil and place in refrigerator for 10-15 mts.\r\n5 Prepare small lemon sized balls and place on baking sheet that has been lined with butter paper. Place each ball about 2 inches apart as they spread. Lightly flatten the balls with a fork. Sprinkle some sugar on top of each ball.\r\n6 Bake in a pre-heated oven at 200 C for about 10-12 mts till the edges are slightly toasted or till done. Once baked, the cookie will feel soft on touch but once cool it will harden. \r\n7 Cool on a wire rack. Repeat with remaining dough. Store in airtight container.\r\n\r\n","image":"http:\/\/www.sailusfood.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/12\/brazilian-coffee-cookies.jpg","image-small":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/brazilian-coffee-cookies-150x150.jpg","image-large":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/brazilian-coffee-cookies-300x300.jpg","style":["easy","modern","quick"],"course":["snack","dessert"],"special-diet":["kid friendly","nut free","egg","pregnancy"],"cuisine":["western"],"cook-time":"10","prep-time":"10","main-ingredient":["coffee","flour","sugar","butter"],"serves":"10","goes-well-with":["milk","coffee","iced coffee"],"author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Cookie Recipes","Flour Recipes","Sweet Dessert Recipes"],"tags":["coffee","cookies"]}
