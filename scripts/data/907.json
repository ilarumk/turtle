Podis or spiced powders\/blends are an essential part of South Indian cuisine with each home having their own versions of preparing it.  We in Andhra share a fondness for our podis and I know of homes who eat podi each and every day, be it breakfast, lunch or dinner. I grew up in a household where podis and pickles were an integral part of our daily meals and not having a jar of pickle or a bottle of podi on the dining table was a rarity. Podis come to our rescue on days when we are rushed up for time or run out of vegetables.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA flavorsome, protein-packed, lentil-spice blend is Kandi Podi, a classic Andhra recipe. Tur dal and channa dal are slow, dry roasted along with red chillis and cumin seeds and finely ground to a coarse powder and finished off with asafoetida and salt. An absolute delight to the senses, almost addictive, Kandi Podi is usually eaten, mixed with white rice and a drizzle of ghee.  \r\n\r\n\r\nKandi Podi\r\nRecipe source: Amma\r\nPrep & Cooking: 20 mts \r\nCuisine: Andhra\r\n.\r\n\r\nIngredients:\r\n\r\n1 small cup kandi pappu\/red gram\/tur dal\r\n\r\n1 small cup senaga pappu\/bengal gram\/channa dal \r\n\r\n1 1\/4 tsps cumin seeds\r\n\r\n7-8 dried red chillis (adjust)\r\n\r\n15 curry leaves (optional)\r\n\r\n1\/2 tsp asafoetida \r\n\r\nsalt to taste \r\n\r\n1 tsp oil\r\n\r\n1 Heat a heavy bottomed vessel and add both the dals and slowly, dry roast on low to medium heat stirring constantly till they turn red.
