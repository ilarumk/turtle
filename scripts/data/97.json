Uthappams are topped with chopped onions, green chillis and vegetables like tomatoes or carrots but can be eaten without the toppings too. Traditionally served as a breakfast item but can be served for lunch or dinner and is a complete meal in itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIngredients:\r\n\r\n1 cup par boiled rice\r\n1 cup raw white rice\r\n1\/2 cup urad dal (black gram dal,minappa pappu)\r\n1 tsp fenugreek seeds\r\nsalt to taste\r\n1\/4 tsp cooking soda\r\n\r\nToppings:\r\nFinely chopped green chillis, sliced onions, grated carrot, finely chopped tomatoes (deseeded), chopped fresh coriander leaves.\r\n\r\nSoak rice, urad dal and fenugreek seeds in water for about 8 hours and grind into a fine paste.\r\nLeave it in a warm place to ferment about 8-10 hours.

Then turn over and cook the other side and let it cook for another 2 minutes.\r\n\r\nServe hot with coconut chutney,coriander chutney or sambar.\r\nNote:You can use left over idli  or dosa batter to make uthappams.\r\n\r\nLentils are a perfect way to add protein, fiber and all the antioxidant benefits to any meal and have the same potent anti-inflammatory antioxidants\u00e2\u20ac\u201dflavonoids and flavonals\u00e2\u20ac\u201dfound in tea, fruits, grapes, red wine and cocoa beans.
