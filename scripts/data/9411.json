I like the deep fried restaurant version but I prefer the healthy home made method where the potatoes are baked before being tossed in a sweet and hot sauce and sprinkled with toasted sesame seeds. Very flavorful and looks appealing in the serving plate. \r\n\r\nSesame Honey Chilli Potatoes Recipe\r\nPrep & Cooking: 30 mts\r\nServes: 4-5 persons\r\nCuisine: Indo-Chinese\r\n.\r\n\r\nIngredients:\r\n\r\n3 potatoes, peeled and cut into fingers like for french fries \r\n\r\n2 crushed garlic cloves\r\n\r\n1 tsp red chilli pwd\r\n\r\n2 tsps tomato sauce\r\n\r\nsalt to taste\r\n\r\n1 1\/2 tbsps oil\r\n\r\nFor sauce:\r\n\r\n1 tbsp tomato sauce\r\n\r\n1 tsp red chilli sauce\r\n\r\n2 tsps vinegar\r\n\r\n2 crushed garlic cloves\r\n\r\n1 1\/2 tbsps honey\r\n\r\n1 tsp chopped coriander leaves (optional) or spring onion greens\r\n\r\n1\/2 tbsp oil\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Combine potato fingers, oil, red chilli pwd, tomato sauce, crushed garlic and salt and place in a ziplock bag and shake well.
