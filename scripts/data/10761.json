I was on an unplanned blogging break, thanks to erratic internet connection. Two weeks ago, on 8th November, Sailu's Kitchen passed its 5th anniversary. I cannot believe that I have been blogging for 5 years. :)\r\n\r\nI want to say 'Thank You' to all my dear readers for all these memorable five years. I hope you will keep visiting my humble blog and leave your valuable comments. Your support and encouragement is deeply appreciated.
