An what a journey its been, virtually connecting with fellow bloggers and readers, diligently responding to reader queries, spending significant amount of man hours updating posts and visiting blogs. Its overwhelming to receive warm emails from readers that touch my heart and make my day. Honestly, its been exhausting at times and frustrating too. But, its you dear readers, your comments, emails and feedback that keep me going and make my journey interesting and fulfilling. \r\n\r\nI want to take this opportunity to thank each and everyone, all my blogging colleagues and friends, readers and visitors of my blog. Thank you for your awards which are much appreciated. If not for all of your support, I would not have come this far and learned so much. Thank you very much for your continued support and love! For you, my friends, a fruity treat! :)\r\n\r\n","image":"http:\/\/www.sailusfood.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/11\/horses.jpg","image-small":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/horses-150x150.jpg","image-large":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/horses-300x300.jpg","author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Misc"],"tags":["anniversary","blog"]}
