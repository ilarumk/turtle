Our harvest festival, Sankranti is around the corner. House cleaning, shopping clothes for family and domestic help(s) and preparation of sweets\/savories is in full swing. Its my favorite time of the year!\r\n\r\nBachala kura Pappu is a high protein, vegan, heart warming dish loaded with nutritious greens - Malabar spinach or Indian Spinach. They go by the name Bachali in Andhra, Basale in Kannada, Vaali Bhaji in Konkani, Mayalu in Marathi and Pui Shak in Bengali. These protein-rich, vibrant green, glossy leaves are thick with a spongy texture and when cut they ooze a slimy juice similar to okra. When cooked with dal, the sliminess is not evident though. We usually cook them with masoor or tur dal or with yam (kanda bachali) and as mustard powder based stew (ava pettina pulusu).\r\n\r\nBachala Kura, Malabar Spinach\r\n\r\n\r\nBachala Kura Pappu Recipe\r\nPreparation: 20 mts\r\nServes 3-4 persons\r\nCuisine: Andhra\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\nIngredients:\r\n\r\n1 small cup tur dal\/red gram dal\/kandi pappu\r\n\r\n2 cups chopped and tightly packed bachali kura\/malabar spinach \r\n\r\n1 onion, chopped\r\n\r\nbig pinch turmeric pwd\r\n\r\n2-3 green chilies, slit lengthwise\r\n\r\n1\/2 tsp chopped ginger\r\n\r\nsalt to taste\r\n\r\n2 cups water\r\n\r\n1 tbsp tamarind paste\r\n\r\nFor seasoning\/poppu\/tadka:\r\n\r\n1\/2 tsp mustard seeds\r\n\r\n1 tsp cumin seeds\r\n\r\n1 tsp urad dal\/minappa pappu\/split gram dal (optional)\r\n\r\n3-4 garlic cloves, crushed\r\n\r\n2 dry red chillis, de-seed and tear\r\n\r\n10-12 fresh curry leaves\r\n\r\n2-3 tsps oil\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 In a pressure cooker, place dal, bachala kura, onions, green chilies, ginger and turmeric pwd.
