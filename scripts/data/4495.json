I made this awesome dish to go with butter naan, ordered from a take away. Found the recipe while flipping through my recipe files, hand written on a paper, barely legible. The recipe caught my attention and I felt an instant desire to try it right away. I had a large capsicum, called for in the recipe, which gave an unassuming sweet touch to the masala-coated chicken. Do use capsicum in this recipe, if you ever try it, as it plays a delightful role, enhancing the over all flavor. I'm glad I gave this recipe a shot. Refreshing change from the routine.\r\n\r\nCapsicum Chicken\r\n\r\nCapsicum Chicken Recipe\r\nMarination: 1-2 hrs, Prep & Cooking: 40 mts\r\nServes 3-4 persons\r\nCuisine: Indian\r\n.\r\n\r\nIngredients:\r\n\r\n1\/2 kg chicken, washed and cut into medium sized pieces\r\n\r\n1 large onion, finely chopped\r\n\r\n2 tomatoes, quartered\r\n\r\n2 capsicums, cut into big pieces\r\n\r\n1 1\/2 tbsps tomato sauce\r\n\r\ngaram masala pwd (1\" dalchini, 1 elaichi and 2 cloves finely ground)\r\n\r\nfresh coriander leaves for garnish\r\n\r\nsalt to taste\r\n\r\n1 1\/2 tbsps oil\r\n\r\nFor marinade: (marinate chicken with below ingredients and place in refrigerator for 2-3 hrs)\r\n\r\n1 tbsp curd\/yogurt\r\n\r\n1\/2 tsp cumin pwd\r\n\r\n1 1\/2 tsps coriander pwd\r\n\r\n1\/2 tsp red chilli pwd\r\n\r\n1\/2 tsp pepper pwd\r\n\r\npinch of turmeric pwd\r\n\r\n1 1\/4 tsps ginger garlic paste\r\n\r\n1 tsp soya sauce\r\n\r\n1 tsp vinegar or lemon juice\r\n\r\nsalt to taste\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Marinate chicken with curd, red chilli pwd, pepper pwd, coriander pwd, cumin pwd, turmeric pwd, lemon juice, soya sauce, salt and ginger-garlic paste for at least 2 hrs.
