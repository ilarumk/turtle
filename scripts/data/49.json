Brewing coffee is an art and one masters with practice and according to one's taste, some like it light or strong or black. To get that perfect decoction, is a ritual that most women follow each and every day.\r\n\r\nThe brass coffee filter in the picture is an antique one used by my grandmother and is more than 75 years old. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA coffee filter is a two portion steel\/brass container. The lower portion is for the collection of the brew that percolates down and the upper part for pouring boiled water and ground coffee beans and a filter is placed within the upper portion. The brew that percolates down can be strong or light depending on the amount of ground coffee added to the filter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGenerally the coffee powder used is Chicory and Pure. We prefer to use the pure one as it has an authentic and aromatic flavor. I pick up my coffee powder at the local coffee bean seller who grinds the coffee beans in my presence and is absolutely fresh.\r\n\r\nOf course, today the traditional coffee filters have given way to the modern electronic coffee makers by reputed brands and are very useful too. We also use the modern coffee maker in our kitchen. We love our coffee, be it filter coffee or instant coffee.\r\n\r\n","author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Indian Drink - Sharbat Recipes","Misc","Personal"],"tags":["coffee","coffee-maker","filter-coffee"]}
