I am always on the look out for recipes of quick snacks with corn to go with my evening cup of tea or coffee. A couple of weeks ago, I prepared Corn Pakoda on a rainy day. Monsoons are that time of the year to savor deep fried comfort food like fritters and munching on garam garm corn pakora with a cup of masala chai is culinary heaven. :)\r\n\r\nThe key to perfect corn pakoda is to use corn kernels of the regular desi (Indian) variety. You can use sweet corn too. Its best to grate the fresh corn, alternately, use a knife to slice through the kernels and coarsely grind them. Very few ingredients go into this snack dish allowing the natural sweet flavor of the corn to stand out. \r\n\r\nCorn Pakora Mixture","image":"http:\/\/www.sailusfood.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/corn-pakora.jpg","image-small":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/corn-pakora-150x150.jpg","image-large":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/corn-pakora-300x300.jpg","style":["easy","quick","traditional"],"course":["snack"],"special-diet":["eggless","nut free","dairy free","vegetarian","vegan","kid friendly","pregnancy"],"cuisine":["indian"],"cook-time":"20","prep-time":"15","main-ingredient":["sweet corn"],"serves":"5","goes-well-with":["chutney","ketchup"],"author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Indian Snacks and Starter Recipes","Indian Vegan Recipes","Indian Vegetarian Recipes","Recipes Vegetable Dishes"],"tags":["snacks","sweet-corn"]}
