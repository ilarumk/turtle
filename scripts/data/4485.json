A large percentage of tender coconuts are devoured by us for coconut water, few mature ones find place in our kitchen, few sent to relatives and friends (especially during Dasara and Karthika Masam) while the remaining are sun dried to extract coconut oil. \r\n\r\nCoconut trees surrounding our home ~ Home grown coconuts\r\n\r\nThe sun-drying part is labor-intensive but thanks to my 'Man Friday' (errand man, driver, malli, home maintenance help, cricket\/carrom board\/board games etc partner to Nehal) who does it, including peeling the coconuts as and when required. My maid helps with grating the coconuts using a traditional coconut grater. God bless them! The peeled husk find place in my maid's kitchen to heat up her mud stove. \r\n\r\nThengai Sadam ~ Coconut Rice\r\n\r\nToday, I prepared South Indian style coconut rice for lunch.
