I have lost count of the number of times I have prepared Banarasi aloo matar ever since I had bookmarked this recipe.  \r\n\r\nLess is more holds true for this incredible vegan potato curry where the star player is tomato. Blanched and ground tomatoes add oodles of flavor and the only three spices that go into the dish are cumin seeds, turmeric powder and red chili powder. The original recipe calls for a very watery gravy dish which is highly recommended. The first few times I prepared aloo matar like a runny gravy. For a change, I reduced the quantity of water so you will find that the dish appears like a thick gravy. I served it with Masala parantha and I cannot explain in words how flavorful and comforting our meal was.\r\n\r\nAloo Matar Sabji with Masala Paratha","image":"http:\/\/www.sailusfood.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/07\/banarasi-aloo-matar-recipe.jpg","image-small":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/banarasi-aloo-matar-recipe-150x150.jpg","image-large":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/banarasi-aloo-matar-recipe-300x300.jpg","style":["easy","traditional"],"course":["main-course"],"special-diet":["eggless","nut free","gluten free","dairy free","vegetarian","vegan","kid friendly","pregnancy"],"cuisine":["north indian"],"cook-time":"20","prep-time":"20","main-ingredient":["potatoes","green peas"],"serves":"5","goes-well-with":["roti"],"author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Indian Curry Recipes","Indian Vegan Recipes","Indian Vegetarian Recipes","North Indian Recipes","Recipes Vegetable Dishes"],"tags":["aloo","matar","potato curry","potatoes","sabji","sabzi"]}
