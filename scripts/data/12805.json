Aratikaya as its known in Andhra is a regular every day vegetable in South Indian vegetarian cuisine. I usually prepare stir fries, yogurt based or tamarind based stew, pachadi and vadas with Raw Plantains. \r\n\r\nThe key is to use fresh and firm green plantains before they ripen to a yellow shade. Today's vegetarian stir fry recipe makes for a perfect side dish with rice, sambar, papad and a  bowl of yogurt. This simple plantain fry calls for a few aromatic spices like cinnamon which brings immense flavor to the well roasted plantains. Tempering of curry leaves and fresh coriander leaves as a final garnish are essential so do not compromise with these ingredients.\r\n\r\nAratikaya Vepudu ~ Raw Plantain Fry\r\n\r\nAratikaya Vepudu Recipe\r\nPrep & Cooking: 35-40 mts\r\nServes: 3-4 \r\nCuisine: Andhra\r\n.\r\n\r\nIngredients:\r\n\r\n2 raw green plantains, peel, slice each plantain lengthwise and slice (place in water)\r\n\r\n1 large onion, finely chopped\r\n\r\n1 tsp ginger-garlic paste\r\n\r\nbig pinch turmeric powder\r\n\r\n1 tsp chilli powder\r\n\r\n1\/2 tsp coriander powder\r\n\r\n1\/4 tsp roasted cumin powder\r\n\r\npinch of methi powder (dry roast and make a fine pwd)\r\n\r\npinch of cinnamon powder\r\n\r\n2 tbsps fresh grated coconut\r\n\r\n1 1\/2 tbsps oil\r\n\r\nsalt to taste\r\n\r\nfresh coriander leaves for garnish\r\n\r\nFor poppu\/tadka\/tempering:\r\n\r\n1\/2 tsp cumin seeds\r\n\r\n2-3 green chilies, slit\r\n\r\n8-10 curry leaves\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1  Mix chili powder, methi powder, turmeric powder, coriander powder, cumin powder, salt, ginger garlic paste and grated coconut to the sliced raw plantain.
