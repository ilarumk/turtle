One such favorite recipe that I cook often and is enjoyed by my family and friends is the Spicy Chicken Masala Curry. Its better than any restaurant recipe. This chicken curry recipe is not a fancy one, very simple, straightforward and quick to make. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t remember the recipe source, its been there in my recipe files since ages, thought I'd share it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are endless variations to the chicken curry and today's chicken curry is prepared with the same basic ingredients as any normal chicken curry, the only other major ingredient is cashewnut paste. The spice level of the curry is high due to the use of black pepper and chilli powder. But the blending of cashewnut paste with the spices offsets the spicy flavor of the curry and gives this dish its unmistakable, not-too-rich, subtly sweet, warm and spicy flavor. \r\n\r\n\r\nSpicy Chicken Masala Recipe\r\nRecipe source: From my recipe files\r\nPrep & Cooking Time: 30-35 mts\r\nServes 4-5 persons\r\nCuisine: South Indian\r\n.\r\n\r\nIngredients:\r\n\r\nMarinate:\r\n\r\n\u00c2\u00bd kg chicken, washed and cut into medium sized pieces\r\n\r\n3 tbsp curds\r\n\r\n1 tsp red chilli powder (adjust to suit your spice level)\r\n\r\n\u00c2\u00bc tsp turmeric pwd\r\n\r\nsalt to taste\r\n\r\nMake a paste:\r\n\r\n6-7 cashewnuts \r\n\r\n4-5 tbsps milk\r\n\r\nDry roast and make a fine powder:\r\n\r\n1\u00e2\u20ac\u009d cinnamon\r\n\r\n10-12 curry leaves\r\n\r\n3 cloves\r\n\r\nRest of the ingredients:\r\n\r\n3-4 tbsps oil \r\n\r\n2 big onions finely chopped\r\n\r\n1 large tomato finely chopped\r\n\r\n1 tsp ginger-garlic paste\r\n\r\n1 tsp coriander powder \r\n\r\n3\/4 tsp black pepper powder (adjust to suit your spice level)\r\n\r\n\u00c2\u00bc tsp cumin powder\r\n\r\ncoriander leaves for garnish\r\n\r\n1 Marinate chicken pieces in chilli powder, turmeric powder, curds and salt for 20 mts.\r\n2 While the chicken pieces are marinating,  make a paste of cashewnuts and milk.
