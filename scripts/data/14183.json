I do not make traditional sweets on a regular basis at home unless celebrating a festival. I bake cupcakes, cookies and cakes on a regular basis especially during Christmas season for family and friends. This festive season, I decided on making some traditional Indian sweets along with Plum cake and cookies. \r\n\r\nI made a batch of fresh paneer to prepare Matar Paneer Masala to go with rotis for dinner. I used half of the fresh paneer to prepare the kheer. To prepare Paneer Kheer, one has to use fresh paneer. Store bought paneer or home made paneer that is not fresh will not work. Sugar can be adjusted to suit your palate. For a creamier texture, I added a little condensed milk. Paneer kheer is delightful topped with any type of adornments, be it raisins, cashew nuts, almond slivers, pistachios or any dry fruit of your choice. \r\n\r\nPaneer Payesh","image":"http:\/\/www.sailusfood.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/12\/paneer-kheer-indian-sweets.jpg","image-small":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/paneer-kheer-indian-sweets-150x150.jpg","image-large":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/paneer-kheer-indian-sweets-300x300.jpg","style":["easy","quick","traditional"],"course":["dessert"],"special-diet":["eggless","dairy","gluten free","vegetarian","kid friendly","pregnancy"],"cuisine":["bengali"],"cook-time":"45","prep-time":"15","main-ingredient":["milk","sugar"],"serves":"4","author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Bengali Food Recipes","Eggless Dessert Recipes","Festival Foods","Indian Festivals","Indian Milk Recipes","Indian Paneer Recipes","Indian Sweets Recipes","Sweet Dessert Recipes"],"tags":["kheer","paneer","paneer-recipes"]}
