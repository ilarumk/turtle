Okra aka Bhindi aka Bendakaya is a much cherished Indian vegetable in our home and we enjoy it in all its avatars. \r\n\r\nBendakaya Vepudu\r\n\r\nA few days ago, I made an Okra fry to go with rotis. Its a slightly different version of the okra fry recipe I blogged earlier. I tend to go back to this Andhra style okra fry recipe often because of its simplicity and tantalizing flavors. The tempering ingredients along with the roasting of the okra yield an incredible flavor. Do try this Indian vegetable recipe which makes for a delectable side with rice and sambar or pappu pulusu and rotis. Left overs make a delicious filling for a sandwich.
