But there are a few Indian oats recipes that are just a breeze to make like today's Oats Roti. All you need to do is add some powdered oats to the regular atta aka wheat flour along with a bit of chick pea flour. Addition of finely minced mixed vegetables and Indian spices powders like cumin and coriander yield flavorful rotis that go well with yogurt and pickle. \r\n\r\nI served the Oats roti with an Andhra style onion potato curry which made a delectable side. And, I must mention that a generous amount finely minced fresh coriander melds well with the spices and gives a wonderful herb-y flavor to the roti.\r\n\r\nOats Vegetable Roti with Potato curry ~ Healthy breakfast ","image":"http:\/\/www.sailusfood.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/09\/oats-vegetable-roti.jpg","image-small":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/oats-vegetable-roti-150x150.jpg","image-large":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/oats-vegetable-roti-300x300.jpg","style":["easy","quick","modern"],"course":["breakfast"],"special-diet":["eggless","dairy free","nut free","vegetarian","vegan","kid friendly","pregnancy"],"cuisine":["north indian"],"cook-time":"15","prep-time":"15","main-ingredient":["oats","wheat flour"],"serves":"4","goes-well-with":["pickle","yogurt"],"author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Flour Recipes","Indian Breakfast Recipes","Lunch Box Recipes","North Indian Recipes","Recipes Vegetable Dishes"],"tags":["indian-recipes-with-oats","oats-roti","paratha"]}
