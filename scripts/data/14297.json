Nehal is fond of creamy corn with pasta or corn fritters while Satish and I like to relish it in the form of a curry with roti or flavored rice. With a lot of fresh corn cobs sitting in my fridge, thanks to a dear friend, I went on a sweet corn binge for a couple days. Made bread pizza with sweet corn, steamed corn cobs, vegetable au gratin with corn being a star player, corn vadas with lots of coriander and sweet corn curry to go with peas pulao. \r\n\r\nCorn Curry","image":"http:\/\/www.sailusfood.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/03\/corn-curry.jpg","image-small":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/corn-curry-150x150.jpg","image-large":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/corn-curry-300x300.jpg","style":["easy","quick","modern"],"course":["side"],"special-diet":["eggless","dairy","gluten free","vegetarian","kid friendly","pregnancy"],"cuisine":["north indian"],"cook-time":"40","prep-time":"15","main-ingredient":["sweet corn"],"serves":"4","goes-well-with":["pulao","roti"],"author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Indian Curry Recipes","Indian Vegetarian Recipes","North Indian Recipes","Recipes Vegetable Dishes"],"tags":["corn-recipes","curry","sweet-corn"]}
