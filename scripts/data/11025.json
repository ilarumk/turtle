The nights are getting chillier and am just loving the weather though it breaks my heart to see Nehal go to school in such cold weather. You see, its rare to find kids wearing sweaters (unless sick) to school in Vizag with this year being an exception. I tell myself its just few more days before school closes for winter vacation (5 1\/2 weeks). Winter holidays, now that's another story.\r\n\r\nToday's weather had me craving for a heart warming soup and spicy noodles. Prepared Sweet corn vegetable soup and Schezwan noodles for lunch. Explosion of flavors to say the least. Reduced the spice factor for Nehal's portion of Schezwan noodles. Its way too spicy for my 8 year old, in fact for us adults as well. :)\r\n\r\nSchezwan Vegetable Noodles Recipe\r\nPrep & Cooking Time: 30 mts\r\nServes 4 persons\r\nCuisine: Indo-Chinese\r\n.\r\n\r\nIngredients:\r\n\r\n1 packet egg noodles (boiled, drained in cold water and tossed in 2 tsps oil)\r\n\r\n1\/4 cup spring onions, finely chopped\r\n\r\n2 cups julienne vegetables (beans (par boil), carrots, cabbage and capsicum)\r\n\r\n1\/2 tsp soya sauce\r\n\r\n1 1\/2 tbsps schezwan sauce (adjust)\r\n\r\n1\/2 tsp brown sugar (optional)\r\n\r\n1\/2 tsp pepper pwd \r\n\r\nsalt as required\r\n\r\n1 1\/2 tbsps sesame oil or peanut oil\r\n\r\n1 tbsp chopped spring onion greens, finely chopped\r\n\r\nSchezwan Sauce\r\n\r\n12 dry red chilies, soak in warm water for 1\/2 hr\r\n\r\n1 tsp grated ginger\r\n\r\n12 garlic cloves\r\n\r\n1 1\/2 tbsp red chilli sauce\r\n\r\n1 tsp soy sauce\r\n\r\n1 1\/2 tsps brown sugar\r\n\r\n3 tsps vinegar\r\n\r\n1 tbsp oil\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Prepare schezwan sauce.
