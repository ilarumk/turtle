Made a simple, lemon-flavored, vibrant colored rice that was not only quick to prepare but brightened up my day. Relished it with yogurt and papads. An all time favorite especially during travel and as picnic food. Love the way how a pinch of turmeric adds color and the visual appeal of seasoning of spices, curry leaves and peanuts, nestled among the rice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLemon Rice\r\nPrep & Cooking: 30 mts\r\nServes 3-4 persons\r\n.\r\n\r\nIngredients:\r\n\r\n1 cup raw rice, cook rice with each grain separate \r\n\r\n8-10 curry leaves \r\n\r\njuice of 3 lemons (approx 6-7 tbsps) adjust\r\n\r\n3-4 tbsps roasted peanuts\r\n\r\nsalt to taste\r\n\r\nTempering\/Poppu\/Tadka:\r\n\r\n1 tbsp oil\r\n\r\n1\/2 tsp mustard seeds\r\n\r\n1 1\/2 tsps urad dal\/minappa pappu\/split gram dal\r\n\r\n1 tbsp channa dal\/senaga pappu\/bengal gram\r\n\r\n2 dry chillis, tear and de-seed\r\n\r\npinch of hing\r\n\r\n1\/2 tsp grated ginger\r\n\r\n2 green chillis, slit\r\n\r\n1\/4 tsp haldi\/turmeric pwd\/pasupu\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Heat oil in a vessel, add the mustard seeds and as they begin to sizzle, add the dals and allow them to turn slightly red, add curry leaves, green chillis, grated ginger, red chillis and stir fry for few more secs.
