I whipped up a very basic lettuce salad recipe that one can never go wrong. A refreshing change from the rich festive food. There are numerous vegetable salad recipes that are healthy with interesting salad dressings but I tend to go back to a simple lettuce salad. This salad has a fresh crunch due to the iceberg lettuce, garlic croutons and nuts. Easy to put together, clean flavors, healthy and works perfect for a picnic or potluck as it can be made ahead. \r\n\r\nI used home made garlic flavored croutons. You can use store bought croutons or alternately, toast three days old bread cubes till crisp and use them. Do not omit the garlic croutons as they provide the necessary crunch and flavor to the salad.","image":"http:\/\/www.sailusfood.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/01\/lettuce-salad.jpg","image-small":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/lettuce-salad-150x150.jpg","image-large":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/lettuce-salad-300x300.jpg","style":["easy","quick","modern"],"course":["salad"],"special-diet":["eggless","dairy free","vegetarian","vegan","kid friendly","pregnancy"],"cuisine":["western"],"prep-time":"20","main-ingredient":["lettuce"],"serves":"4","goes-well-with":["soup"],"author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Green Leafy Vegetables","Recipes Vegetable Dishes","Salad Recipes"],"tags":["lettuce","lettuce-salad","salad"]}
