When I eat Chinese at a restaurant, this heart warming chicken soup or sweet corn vegetable soup is always a part of our meal. One of the simplest soup recipes that can be made at home and I guarantee you that this soup will give any good Indian Chinese restaurant a run for its money. Seriously, its that good. \r\n\r\nBasically one needs to follow three crucial steps while making this soup. These include the use of cream style corn, chicken stock and egg drop that gives the soup its wonderful texture. The soup has a sweet-salty flavor where shredded chicken is simmered in a sesame oil toasted chicken broth and cream style corn. I use white pepper powder to season my soup which lends a subtle hint of spice. You can also add finely chopped carrots and beans, thought its purely optional. \r\n\r\nOne sure shot way to win the heart of your loved ones is to serve them this flavorful restaurant style sweet corn chicken soup. :)\r\n\r\nIndo Chinese Sweet Corn Chicken Soup","image":"http:\/\/www.sailusfood.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/sweet-corn-chicken-soup-recipe.jpg","image-small":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/sweet-corn-chicken-soup-recipe-150x150.jpg","image-large":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/sweet-corn-chicken-soup-recipe-300x300.jpg","style":["easy","quick","modern"],"course":["soup"],"special-diet":["egg","dairy free","gluten free","non vegetarian","kid friendly","pregnancy"],"cuisine":["indo chinese"],"cook-time":"20","prep-time":"20","main-ingredient":["chicken","cream style corn"],"serves":"4","goes-well-with":["salad"],"author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Indian Chicken Recipes","Indian Chinese Recipes","Indian Non-Vegetarian Recipes","Indian Soup Recipes"],"tags":["chicken","indo-Chinese_recipes","soup","sweet-corn"]}
