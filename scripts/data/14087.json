Its a slightly thicker version of the famous Andhra Pesarattu which is prepared with green moong dal, ginger and green chilies. But the traditional Adai recipe calls for 3-4 varieties of lentils besides raw rice, red and green chilies and ginger. \r\n\r\nI hope many of you looking for healthy oats recipes in Indian style are finding the oats for breakfast series useful. To boost the already nutritious profile of Adai, I added fibre rich oats to the lentil-rice batter. The addition of oats did not alter the taste of Oats Adai and my folks relished the crisp lentil dosa with pickle. I highly recommend you try Oats Adai recipe for a filling, healthy and tasty breakfast.\r\n\r\nProtein rice Oats Adai","image":"http:\/\/www.sailusfood.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/11\/oats-adai.jpg","image-small":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/oats-adai-150x150.jpg","image-large":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/oats-adai-300x300.jpg","style":["easy","quick","modern"],"course":["breakfast"],"special-diet":["eggless","dairy free","nut free","gluten free","vegetarian","vegan","kid friendly","pregnancy"],"cuisine":["south indian"],"cook-time":"15","prep-time":"30","main-ingredient":["oats","lentils"],"serves":"3","goes-well-with":["chutney","pickle"],"author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Indian Breakfast Recipes","Indian Lentil Recipes","Indian Vegan Recipes","Indian Vegetarian Recipes","South Indian Recipes"],"tags":["adai","indian-recipes-with-oats","oats"]}
