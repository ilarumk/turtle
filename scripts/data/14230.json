Kadala is a coconut based kala chana (black chickpeas) curry that is rich in protein and lip smacking good when eaten with Puttu. The first time I tasted an authentic style chickpea curry was at a home stay in Wayanad and I was blown away. The combination of the rice flour steamed cakes with the fragrant and subtly spiced chickpea curry was comforting and filling enough to see me through the whole day. \r\n\r\nShallots aka sambar onions and fresh coconut are essential ingredients. I wouldn't suggest skipping coconut milk because it elevates the flavor of the curry by leaps and bounds and provides the much needed gravy to the dish. Warming flavors, rich and comforting, Kadala curry is one of the classic Kerala vegetarian recipes you will ever taste.  \r\n\r\nKadala Curry ~ Kerala style black chickpea curry","image":"http:\/\/www.sailusfood.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/12\/kadala-curry.jpg","image-small":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/kadala-curry-150x150.jpg","image-large":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/kadala-curry-300x300.jpg","style":["easy","quick","traditional"],"course":["breakfast"],"special-diet":["eggless","dairy free","nut free","gluten free","vegetarian","vegan","kid friendly","pregnancy"],"cuisine":["Kerala"],"cook-time":"30","prep-time":"15","main-ingredient":["black chickpeas","coconut"],"serves":"5","goes-well-with":["puttu"],"author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Indian Vegan Recipes","Indian Vegetarian Recipes","Kerala Recipes","South Indian Recipes"],"tags":["kadala","kerala-food"]}
