How about a classic Indian sweet recipe, Doodh Peda aka Milk Fudge, that makes for an ideal Christmas treat for family and friends. Pedas are rich, sweet and quick to make with hardly any preparation time. I made them over stove top which took a couple of minutes of cooking compared to Microwave. \r\n\r\nI have taken the short cut method to prepare Doodh Peda using condensed milk and milk powder. The traditional version of Doodh Peda is labor intensive but has a flavor and texture that is creamy and absolutely melt-in-the-mouth. You can look forward to the traditional Pala Kova aka Doodh Peda recipe in a couple of weeks.\r\n\r\nDoodh Peda\r\n\r\nI accidentally added more than required milk powder hence the cracked look of the pedas. The key to a soft and smooth peda is to lightly grease your fingers and palm and roll out into small balls and go slow on milk powder.","image":"http:\/\/www.sailusfood.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/11\/recipe-for-peda-milk-fudge.jpg","image-small":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/recipe-for-peda-milk-fudge-150x150.jpg","image-large":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/recipe-for-peda-milk-fudge-300x300.jpg","style":["easy","quick","modern"],"course":["dessert"],"special-diet":["dairy","eggless","gluten free","vegetarian","kid friendly","pregnancy"],"cuisine":["North Indian"],"cook-time":"10","prep-time":"10","main-ingredient":["Milk Powder","Condensed Milk"],"serves":"18","author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Eggless Dessert Recipes","Festival Foods","Indian Milk Recipes","Sweet Dessert Recipes"],"tags":["doodh-peda","milk-fudge","peda"]}
