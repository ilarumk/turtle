There are both baked and deep fried versions of doughnuts recipe. With requests for easy dessert recipes, I am sharing with you a deep fried version without yeast, using ingredients that are easily available in your pantry. These indulgent treats are traditionally sweet and often ring shaped like our South Indian Vada.
