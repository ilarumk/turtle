Beaten rice or flattened rice flakes is a popular ingredient that is used to prepare many varieties of savory and sweet dishes for Janmashtami. There are numerous variations to the Atukula laddu recipe which is also known as Atukula Unda\/Vundalu in Andhra. A popular variation is the additon of dry coconut powder, roasted chick peas (dalia) or peanuts and jaggery. \r\n\r\nToday, I am posting a slightly different version of the beaten rice recipe which calls for yellow moong dal, vermicelli and powdered sugar. These laddus can be stored upto a month in an air tight container. Just ensure that you grind all the ingredients to a very fine powder before forming the mixture into laddus. \r\n\r\nMore Sri Krishna Jayanthi festival recipes\r\n","image":"http:\/\/www.sailusfood.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/beaten-rice-sweet-recipe.jpg","image-small":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/beaten-rice-sweet-recipe-150x150.jpg","image-large":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/beaten-rice-sweet-recipe-300x300.jpg","style":["easy","traditional"],"course":["dessert"],"special-diet":["eggless","nuts","dairy free","vegetarian","kid friendly","pregnancy"],"cuisine":["andhra"],"cook-time":"15","prep-time":"20","main-ingredient":["beaten rice","sugar"],"serves":"16","author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Andhra Recipes","Festival Foods","Indian Festivals","Indian Sweets Recipes","Sweet Dessert Recipes"],"tags":["beaten rice","festival_sweets","laddu"]}
