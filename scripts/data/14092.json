Sipping on loads of ginger tea and trying to find my blogging mojo. Looked through my drafts and found a couple of recipes that are blog worthy. One of them being a simple classic Andhra style vegetarian fry using cabbage, chana dal (bengal gram), coriander leaves and coconut. This cabbage fry is for all those readers who request for veg Indian food recipes that are quick to make and healthy.\r\n\r\nThis Andhra style veg recipe works best when you are in a rush and have to fix a quick nutrition rich meal. Cabbage fry fits the bill and you have a super satisfying stir fry side dish to go with rice, pepper rasam and papad. Makes for a comforting winter mid day meal.\r\n\r\nCabbage Fry","image":"http:\/\/www.sailusfood.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/11\/cabbage-fry-veg-indian-food.jpg","image-small":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/cabbage-fry-veg-indian-food-150x150.jpg","image-large":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/cabbage-fry-veg-indian-food-300x300.jpg","style":["easy","quick","traditional"],"course":["side"],"special-diet":["eggless","dairy free","nut free","gluten free","vegetarian","vegan","kid friendly","pregnancy"],"cuisine":["Andhra"],"cook-time":"25","prep-time":"10","main-ingredient":["cabbage","coconut"],"serves":"4","goes-well-with":["rice"],"author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Andhra Recipes","Indian Fry Recipes","Indian Vegan Recipes","Indian Vegetarian Recipes","Recipes Vegetable Dishes","South Indian Recipes"],"tags":["andhra-recipes","cabbage","fry"]}
