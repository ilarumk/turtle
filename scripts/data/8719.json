Refreshing with combination of textures - both avocado and mango being creamy, and lettuce providing a bit of crunch, the salad has a mingling of savory and sweet flavors. Perfect hot weather salad that is simply outstanding. One of the best refreshing salads I have had in recent times. \r\n\r\nAvocado ~ Home grown ripe mangoes\r\n\r\nIn a bowl, whisk 1 crushed garlic, a tbsp of lemon juice, a tbsp of olive oil, salt and crushed pepper to taste and a tbsp of honey. Add 1 peeled and sliced ripe mango, 1 peeled and sliced avocado, 1 sliced red bell pepper and washed and torn lettuce. Toss well till combined with dressing. Serve chilled garnished with basil or coriander leaves. \r\n\r\n","image":"http:\/\/www.sailusfood.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/05\/avocado-mango-salad.jpg","image-small":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/avocado-mango-salad-150x150.jpg","image-large":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/avocado-mango-salad-300x300.jpg","style":["easy","modern","quick"],"course":["main","salad"],"special-diet":["nut free","eggless","dairy free","vegetarian","vegan","kid friendly","pregnancy"],"cuisine":["mexican"],"cook-time":"0","prep-time":"10","main-ingredient":["avocado","mango"],"serves":"3","author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Featured Recipes","Indian Vegan Recipes","Indian Vegetarian Recipes","Raw Food Recipes","Recipes Vegetable Dishes","Salad Recipes"],"tags":["avocado","mango","raw-food","salad"]}
