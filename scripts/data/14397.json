The 'king of fruits' is reigning high this summer in our local rhythu bazaar (farmer's market) and the varieties available seem endless. I have had my fair share of mangoes in its pure form this season. Recently, I got down to incorporating it into an elegant Italian dessert, Panna Cotta (meaning'cooked cream' in Italian). The luscious tropical flavor of ripe mangoes pairs beautifully with soft and creamy Panna Cotta.\r\n\r\nI have used agar agar (also goes by the name china grass) instead of gelatin for a vegetarian version. Love panna cotta for its versality and ease of preparation. The key is to get the right texture which is not too firm but soft with a bit of wooble, like the texture of custard. The next time you throw a party, serve your friends this classic pudding which is one of the easiest mango dessert recipes out there. You sure will hear a lot of 'oohs' and 'aahs'. :)\r\n\r\nMango Panna Cotta\r\n","image":"http:\/\/www.sailusfood.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/05\/mango-dessert-recipes.jpg","image-small":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/mango-dessert-recipes-150x150.jpg","image-large":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/mango-dessert-recipes-300x300.jpg","style":["easy","quick","modern"],"course":["dessert"],"special-diet":["eggless","dairy","nut free","vegetarian","kid friendly","pregnancy"],"cuisine":["italian"],"cook-time":"20","prep-time":"15","main-ingredient":["ripe mangoes","heavy cream"],"serves":"4","author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Eggless Dessert Recipes","Fruit Recipes","Sweet Dessert Recipes"],"tags":["dessert","mango","panna cotta"]}
