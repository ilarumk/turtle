The vegetables I use for the regular pulao are carrots, beans, peas and potatoes. I rarely use cauliflower and capsicum for pulao. I use whole spices instead of masala powder which yields an aromatic mild flavor to the rice and a combination of ghee and oil for frying the vegetables which brings out their flavor beautifully.\r\n\r\nVegetable Pulao\r\n\r\nIts difficult giving exact proportions of ingredients and spices while writing a recipe since most of my cooking is done by 'andaz'. Sometimes, I just follow my mood and the available ingredients\/spices while preparing a dish like today's recipe. I try my best to be close to the required amount of spices used in a particular dish while writing the recipe. \r\n\r\nVegetable Pulao Recipe\r\nPrep & Cooking: 45 mts\r\nServes 4-5 persons\r\n.\r\n\r\nIngredients:\r\n\r\n2 cups basmati rice \u00e2\u20ac\u201c washed and drained\r\n\r\n1 1\/2 tbsps ghee \r\n\r\n1 tbsp oil\r\n\r\n2 green cardamoms\r\n\r\n4 cloves\r\n\r\n2\u00e2\u20ac\u009d cinnamom stick\r\n\r\n1 star anise\r\n\r\n2 bay leaves\r\n\r\nvery small pinch nutmeg pwd\r\n\r\n2 onions finely sliced\r\n\r\n1\/2 tbsp ginger-garlic-green chilli paste\r\n\r\n1 1\/2 tbsps of fresh mint leaves\/pudina, finely chopped\r\n\r\n1 1\/2 tbsps fresh coriander leaves, finely chopped\r\n\r\n1 1\/2 cups chopped mixed vegetables (beans, green peas, carrots and potatoes)\r\n\r\n1 tomato, chopped\r\n\r\n1\/2 cup thick coconut milk \r\n\r\n3 1\/4 cups water \r\n\r\nsalt to taste\r\n\r\n8-10 cashew nuts (lightly roasted in ghee till golden brown) \r\n\r\ncoriander leaves for garnish\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n1 Heat ghee and oil in a vessel, add bay leaves, cinnamon, cloves, caradamom and star anise and stir for a few seconds.
