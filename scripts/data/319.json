It has been a very long break and an enjoyable one, but I missed visiting my favorite food blogs and participating in some wonderful full-filled food events. Now that I'm back, I sure will be spending more time catching up with the latest in the food blogosphere.\r\n\r\nOne of my regular visitors requested me to post more podi recipes like Kariveppakku Podi (curry leaves spiced powder). So, today I am posting one of my favorite podi recipes called Nuvvullu Podi or Sesame seeds spiced powder. This podi is prepared with white sesame seeds, lentils, garlic and spices which are roasted and ground to a coarse powder giving it an irresistable, aromatic addictive flavor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSeasame seeds are used in a variety of Andhra vegetarian preparations like Pulihora, Nuvvulu Annam, Paala Undrallu, Nuvvu pettina gutti vankaya kura( stuffed brinjal curry) to name a few. Nuvvulu or seasame seeds give a distinctive flavor to the dish being prepared.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is something very addictive about nuvvulu or seasame seeds which is rich in protein and highly nutritious. Though not aromatic, when ground with other spices like toasted dry red chillis, garlic, coriander seeds, cumin seeds and lentils, the earthy, nutty flavor of seasame seeds overpowers the flavor of the remaining spices. The mingling of flavors is simply irresistable, making it one of my favorites podis. A must-have podi in my pantry!!\r\n\r\n\r\nNuvvullu Podi - Spiced Sesame Seeds Powder Recipe\r\nRecipe source: Adapted from Kanthamma\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cook Book\r\nPrep & Cooking: 25 mts \r\nCuisine: Andhra\r\n.\r\n\r\nIngredients:\r\n\r\n2 cups white seasame seeds\r\n\r\n1\/2 cup senaga pappu (bengal gram)\r\n\r\n1\/2 cup minappa pappu (split black gram dal)\r\n\r\n1 tbsp cumin seeds\r\n\r\n2 tbsps coriander seeds\r\n\r\n6-7 dried red chillis \r\n\r\n8-10 crushed garlic pods\r\n\r\nsalt to taste \r\n\r\n1 tbsp oil \r\n1 Add a tbsp of oil in a pan and add the Bengal gram and split black gram dal and fry them on medium heat till they turn red.
