I made a simple and comforting rice dish featuring dondakaya as the star ingredient.  The combination of dondakaya and fresh coconut is eternally comforting especially as a stir fry. Perfumed with whole garam masala, spiced with green chilies, sweetened with coconut, Dondakaya rice recipe is jazzed up with a squeeze of fresh lemon and brightened with fresh coriander. All you tindora haters, I encourage you to try Tindora rice which is sure to get your tastebuds dancing.\r\n\r\nI served the Tindora rice with our favorite Aloo kurma, the recipe of which I will post soon. Its a slightly different version of the Aloo Kurma recipe I posted earlier.\r\n\r\nTindora Rice","image":"http:\/\/www.sailusfood.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/10\/dondakaya-annam.jpg","image-small":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/dondakaya-annam-150x150.jpg","image-large":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/dondakaya-annam-300x300.jpg","style":["easy","quick"],"course":["main-course"],"special-diet":["eggless","dairy free","gluten free","vegetarian","kid friendly","pregnancy"],"cuisine":["Andhra"],"cook-time":"35","prep-time":"20","main-ingredient":["Dondakaya","Basmati Rice","Garam Masala"],"serves":"5","goes-well-with":["raita","curry"],"author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Andhra Recipes","Indian Rice recipes","Indian Vegetarian Recipes","Lunch Box Recipes"],"tags":["annam","dondakaya","pulao","tindora"]}
