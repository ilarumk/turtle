I made a tomato based chutney to go with sponge dosas for breakfast today. Made for a delectable combination. Calcium rich sesame seeds play a vital role in this vibrant colored chutney that is simple yet impressive. Asafoetida-infused tempering adds a subtle backdrop to the chutney which has a tangy-nutty flavor.\r\n\r\nTomato Nuvvula Pachadi\r\n\r\nTomato Nuvvula Pachadi Recipe\r\nPrep & Cooking: 20-25 mts\r\nServes 4-5 persons\r\nCuisine: Andhra\r\n.\r\n\r\nIngredients:\r\n\r\n4 tomatoes \r\n\r\n2 tbsps toasted sesame seeds\r\n\r\n2 green chillis\r\n\r\n1 dry red chilli\r\n\r\n1\/2 tsp cumin seeds\r\n\r\n1 1\/2 tsps urad dal\/minappa pappu\r\n\r\n1 tbsp tamarind paste \r\n\r\nsalt to taste\r\n\r\n2 tsps oil\r\n\r\nFor tempering\/tadka\/poppu:\r\n\r\n1 tsp oil\r\n\r\n1\/2 tsp mustard seeds\r\n\r\npinch of asafoetida\/inguva\/hing\r\n\r\n10-12 fresh curry leaves\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Heat oil in a cooking vessel, cumin seeds and urad dal and red chilli and saute till the dal turns red.
