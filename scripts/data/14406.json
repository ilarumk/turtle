These white lacy pancakes have a crisp side with an airy, soft on touch, fluffy center. Appam recipe uses minimal ingredients, simple to make and usually served with a range of sides like vegetable stew or chicken stew, sweetened coconut milk, Kerala egg cury, egg roast, korma, chutney and kadala curry.\r\n\r\nAppam cooking in a non stick appam pan\r\n\r\nTraditional appam preparation calls for the use of toddy aka kallu for the frementation of the appam batter. The alternate methods for fermenting appam batter are yeast or cooked appam batter in place of toddy. I have prepared appam recipe with both yeast as well as cooked appam batter and I prefer the latter in terms of flavor. I served Appam with Kerala style vegetable stew and egg roast, the recipes of which I will post tomorrow.\r\n\r\nKerala Appam ~ Lacy White Hoppers\r\n ","image":"http:\/\/www.sailusfood.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/appam-recipe.jpg","image-small":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/appam-recipe-150x150.jpg","image-large":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/appam-recipe-300x300.jpg","style":["easy","traditional"],"course":["breakfast"],"special-diet":["eggless","dairy free","gluten free","vegetarian","vegan","kid friendly","pregnancy"],"cuisine":["kerala"],"cook-time":"45","prep-time":"20","main-ingredient":["rice","coconut"],"serves":"18","goes-well-with":["stew"],"author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Flour Recipes","Indian Breakfast Recipes","Indian Vegan Recipes","Indian Vegetarian Recipes","Kerala Recipes","South Indian Recipes"],"tags":["appam","breakfast","kerala-food"]}
