One of them being regular availability of freshly caught sea food, especially fish. Today I bought Vanjaram (spotted seer fish) and prepared a simple roast with minimal spices. Nehal and Satish relish it and so do I. :) There are few things I love more than a nicely roasted fish, hot off the pan. \r\n\r\nVanjaram Vepudu\r\n\r\nYou can explore with different spices but go slow on the amount of spices you'd add to the marinade. You wouldn't want the spices to overpower the flavor of fish. I have avoided garam masala but a pinch can be added. Do not omit lemon since its the key to the bright flavor of fish roast.\r\n\r\n Vanjaram Vepudu Recipe\r\nPrep: 6-7 mts, Marination: 20-30 mts, Cooking Time: 22-25 mts\r\nServes 4 persons\r\nCuisine: Andhra\r\n.\r\n\r\nIngredients:\r\n\r\n8-9 medium sized fish fillet, washed \r\n\r\n1 1\/2 tbsp ginger-garlic paste \r\n\r\njuice of one lemon\r\n\r\npinch cumin pwd\r\n\r\nlarge pinch coriander powder\r\n\r\npinch turmeric pwd\r\n\r\n1 1\/2 tsps red chilli pwd\r\n\r\nsalt to taste\r\n\r\n1 1\/4 tbsps oil\r\n\r\nfew curry leaves\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Combine ginger garlic paste, lemon juice, salt, red chilli pwd, turmeric pwd, cumin pwd and coriander pwd in a flat dish. Apply this marinade lightly to the fish pieces and keep aside for 20-30 mts.\r\n2 Heat oil in a non-stick pan, add few curry leaves, place the marinated fish and fry for 14-15 mts on low to medium flame.\r\n 3 Once its nicely browned, flip over gently to the other side and roast fish for another 10-12 mts till browned.\r\n4 Serve hot with onion rings and lemon wedges.\r\n\r\nChepa Vepudu ~ Fish Fry","image":"http:\/\/www.sailusfood.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/11\/fish-fry.jpg","image-small":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/fish-fry-150x150.jpg","image-large":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/fish-fry-300x300.jpg","main-ingredient":["fish"],"author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Andhra Recipes","Indian Non-Vegetarian Recipes","Indian Seafood Recipes"],"tags":["fish","vanjaram"]}
