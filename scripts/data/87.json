They also contain the antioxidant glutathione, which helps boost immune function.Infact eating cooked tomatoes is better for our body as the heat allows more desirable antioxidants in tomatoes to be made available to the body. And because lycopene is fat-soluble, eating tomatoes with oil can improve absorption.\r\n\r\nGarlic is one of oldest culinary herb, full of antioxidants, that keeps the heart healthy by lowering cholesterol levels, reducing blood pressure, fighting free radicals and keeping blood from clotting.\r\n\r\nTurmeric has been used for centuries in India as a spice in ancient Indian food and medicinal herb to treat a host of ailments.A major notable inflammation-fighting compound called curcuminoids is present in turmeric and the most important of these is curcumin.Curcumin is as powerful an antioxidant as vitamins C and E and even beta-carotene.Antioxidants are also powerful preservatives, which also explain why using turmeric in food helps retain its freshness.\r\nIngredients:\r\n\r\n1 medium sized cauliflower (wash the florets and blanche in salted water)\r\n8-10 garlic flakes\r\n4 medium sized onions finely chopped\r\n1\/4 tsp turmeric pwd\r\n1 tsp red chilli pwd\r\n1\/2 tsp coriander pwd\r\n1\/4 tsp cumin pwd\r\nsalt to taste\r\n3 big tomatoes finely chopped\r\nbig pinch of garam masala pwd\r\noil\r\n1\/2 tsp jaggery(optional)\r\nchopped fresh coriander leaves for garnish\r\n\r\nHeat 1 tsp butter or oil in a vessel and add the blanched florets and stir fry for 4-5 mts continuosly till you get a light golden color.Remove and keep aside.\r\nIn the same vessel add 1 tbsp oil and add garlic flakes and fry for 10-15 seconds.Now add the chopped onions and fry till transparent.\r\nAdd all the powders except garam masala and salt and mix well.\r\nAdd the tomaotes and cook till oil seperates.\r\nAdd the fried florets and cook covered on low heat for 3 mts.\r\nAdd 3\/4 cup water,jaggery and garam masala and cook till you get the desired gravy consistency.\r\nGarnish with chopped coriander leaves.\r\nThis low calorie and vegetarian recipe goes well with rice or rotis.\r\n\r\nFood,Food Blogs,Vegetarian ,Indian Cooking,Antioxidants,Flickr","main-ingredient":["cauliflower"],"author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Andhra Recipes","Indian Curry Recipes","Indian Vegetarian Recipes","Recipes Vegetable Dishes"]}
