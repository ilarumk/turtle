They are round to oval in shape with a thinner skin unlike the purple eggplants. The small purple variety of brinjals are used to prepare the famous Andhra delicacy Gutti Vankaaya Kura (stuffed brinjal curry). The green brinjal has fewer seeds and are white which is a sign that they are fresh and tender. These eggplants have a delicate flavor and cook easily and are best suited to prepare this dish and Vankaaya Pachadi, an Andhra brinjal chutney recipe similar to Baingan Ka Bharta.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThese eggplants sometimes have a bitter taste, especially during summers, and you can offset the bitterness by sprinkling a tsp of salt over them and place them in a colander so that the bitter juice of the brinjal pieces trickles down. Then wash them thoroughly in water and squeeze off excess water. Vakaaya Paalu (milk) Posina (pour) Kura is a very simple, easy-to-make, healthy dish where the brinjals (as name suggests in Telugu) are cooked in milk which gives the curry a rich and sweet flavor. \r\n\r\nVankaaya Paalu Posina Kura\r\nIngredients\r\n1 large green brinjal (chopped into small cubes and place in salted water for 10 mts)\r\n\r\n1 finely chopped onion\r\n1 slit green chilli\r\n1 tsp cumin seeds\r\n5-6 slightly crushed garlic cloves\r\n1\u00e2\u20ac\u009d finely minced ginger piece\r\n1 tsp red chilli pwd (adjust)\r\npinch of turmeric pwd\r\n1 tsp coriander pwd\r\nsalt to taste\r\n1  cup skimmed milk\r\n10 curry leaves\r\n1 tbsp oil\r\n\r\nHeat oil in a cooking vessel, add the cumin seeds and let them brown.\r\nNow add the garlic, ginger, curry leaves and green chilli and fry for a few seconds taking care not to burn the tempering.\r\nAdd the chopped onions and saute till the onions turn pink.\r\nAdd the chopped brinjals and saute them for a few mts. Add the chilli pwd, coriander pwd and turmeric pwd. Combine.\r\nAdd salt and continue to saute for another 3-4 mts on slow fire. Now cover with a lid and cook till the brinjals are almost cooked.\r\nNow add the milk and go on stirring on medium heat till milk is completely combined with the brinjals and you attain a thick curry consistency. This could take about 7-8 mts. You need to ensure that the milk doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t curdle, so keep stirring till the brinjals are fully cooked in the milk and then turn off fire. Garnish with coriander leaves.\r\nServe with steamed rice  or rotis.\r\n\r\nNote:You can make this curry with other brinjal varieties like Thai Eggplants or the purple variety. Ensure that they are tender and offset any bitterness before cooking the brinjals. Some tips on cooking brinjals that I generally follow...If the skin is shrivelled and the seeds are black, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even think of using them, as they have matured and best discarded.Try to avoid cooking them in metallic utensils as they discolor the eggplants. Soak the chopped brinjals in water as they discolor when exposed to air. Soaking the eggplants in salted water before cooking ensures that the salted water removes any bitterness. Try to cook brinjals with the skin as the skin of the brinjal is rich in flavonoids and other antioxidants, which can help reduce the risk of heart disease. Eggplant is low in calories, high in potassium and vitamin K with good fibre content. Read more about the medicinal and health benefits of eggplants.
