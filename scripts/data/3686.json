I am especially enamored by this particular stir fry (I could eat it every day and still never get enough). A second helping is always a must with this stir fry. Any left overs (which is rare), goes as a filling in my sandwich.\r\n\r\nThe addition of onions which are caramalized provide crunch along with urad dal which is a vital ingredient in this recipe along with crushed garlic. The key is to serve it warm, when the flavor is mellow as you bite into the soft, crisp garlic-scented potato. Serve with rice and rasam OR rotis and dal.\r\n\r\n\r\nBangala dumpa Vepudu Recipe\r\nPrep & Cooking: 30 mts\r\nServes: 4-5 persons\r\nCuisine: Andhra\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\nIngredients:\r\n\r\n3 large potatoes, washed, boiled, peeled and cubed\r\n\r\n1 large onion, quarted and sliced\r\n\r\npinch of turmeric pwd\r\n\r\n1 1\/2 tsp red chilli pwd (adjust)\r\n\r\n1\/4 tsp coriander pwd\r\n\r\n1\/4 tsp cumin pwd\r\n\r\nlarge pinch methi pwd\r\n\r\nsalt to taste\r\n\r\n1 tbsp oil\r\n\r\nPoppu\/tadka\/seasoning:\r\n\r\n1\/2 tsp mustard seeds\r\n\r\n3\/4 tsp cumin seeds\r\n\r\n1 tsp urad dal\/minappa pappu\/split gram dal\r\n\r\n1 sprig curry leaves\r\n\r\n2-3 crushed garlic cloves\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Heat oil in a cooking vessel, add the mustard seeds and as they crackle, add the cumin seeds and urad dal and allow the dal to turn red.
