There are numerous easy to cook recipes that we are not aware of and I try to unearth a few culinary gems and add them to my repertoire. One such classic is Gujarati dal recipe that is a super hit at home. Most Gujarati food recipes call for the addition of jaggery or sugar and you will find a hint of sweetness in their everyday meals. I love Gujarati vegetarian food especially the dhokla, everyday shaak (subji\/kuralu) and dal.\r\n\r\nOur lunch ~ Phulka, Gujarati dal, Bhindi fry, curd, slices of raw tomato\r\n\r\nGujarati Dal is a refreshing change from the usual everyday dal. The flavors are complex, khati meeti - tangy and sweet with a hint of spice. Love how the flavors mingle to bring out a winner of a recipe and make for a fantastic side with phulkas. You can serve it with rice as well and let me tell you that it is finger licking good. :)\r\n\r\n\r\n","image":"http:\/\/www.sailusfood.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/11\/gujarati-dal.jpg","image-small":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/gujarati-dal-150x150.jpg","image-large":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/gujarati-dal-300x300.jpg","cook-time":"20","prep-time":"15","main-ingredient":["tur dal","jaggery"],"serves":"5","author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Flour Recipes","Gujarati Recipes","Indian Breakfast Recipes","Indian Chinese Recipes","Indian Dal Recipes","Indian Lentil Recipes","Indian Soup Recipes","Indian Sweets Recipes","Indian Vegan Recipes","Indian Vegetarian Recipes"],"tags":["dal","gujarati-food","tur-dal"]}
