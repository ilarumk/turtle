It isn't pouring yet, just a  few showers during the night and one wakes up to pleasant, cool and windy weather. The landscape outside my bedroom window is spectacular. After Nehal left for school (his first day after summer vacation) this morning, I sat outside with a cup of hot tea, reading the newspaper and enjoying the weather. I was also in a mood to bake and prepared a quick basic eggless cake for Nehal.\r\n\r\nSuch weather also calls for hearty, warming, comforting foods. This kootu recipe is so perfect for this time of the year. Lightly spiced moong dal and ridge gourd combination is a match made in heaven. Very nurturing to the body and soul. And not to mention, the weather makes it extra delicious. :)\r\n\r\n\r\nBeerakaya Pesarapappu Kootu Recipe\r\nPrep & Cooking: 30 mts\r\nServes 4-5 persons\r\nCuisine: Andhra\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\nIngredients:\r\n\r\n1 small cup pesarapappu\/moong dal, washed \r\n\r\n2 cups ridge gourd, peeled and cut into small pieces\r\n\r\n1\/4 tsp turmeric pwd\r\n\r\nsalt to taste\r\n\r\nMake a paste:\r\n\r\n2 tbsps grated coconut\r\n\r\n2 green chillis\r\n\r\n1 tsp cumin seeds\r\n\r\nFor seasoning\/poppu\/tadka:\r\n\r\n1\/2 tsp mustard seeds\r\n\r\n1\/2 tsp split black gram dal (urad dal\/minapappu)\r\n\r\nbig pinch asafoetida\/inguva\/hing\r\n\r\nfew fresh curry leaves\r\n\r\n2 tsps oil or ghee\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Pressure cook moong dal, ridge gourd pieces with 2 cups of water  and turmeric pwd upto two whistles.
