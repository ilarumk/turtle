Its easy to prepare with very less cooking time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nToday I prepared it as an accompaniment with dosas for breakfast and with pulagam (an andhra lentil rice preparation, similar to khichdi) for lunch. This healthy low calorie chutney has a sweet-tart flavor with a subtle spice taste and the key to this chutney is the use of fresh curry leaves. The tempering of the spices like cumin seeds and curry leaves blend with the tomato puree, grated ginger and jaggery, giving it an irresistible flavor.\r\nTomato Chutney Recipe\r\n\r\nRecipe source:  Revathi Aunty (friend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s amma)\r\nPrep & Cooking: 20 mts\r\nServes 4-5 persons\r\nCuisine: South Indian\r\n.\r\n\r\nIngredients:\r\n\r\n3 large ripe juicy tomatoes (blanch, de-skin and puree)\r\n\r\n1 tsp grated ginger\r\n\r\n2-3 green chillis (slit length wise)\r\n\r\npinch of turmeric\r\n\r\n1 1\/2 cups of water\r\n\r\n1\/2 tsp jaggery or sugar (optional)\r\n\r\nred chilli pwd (according to your spice level) - optional\r\n\r\nsalt to taste\r\n\r\npinch of asafoetida (optional)\r\n\r\ncoriander leaves for garnish\r\n\r\nFor tempering\/tadka\/poppu:\r\n\r\n1 tbsp oil\r\n\r\n1 tsp mustard seeds\r\n\r\n3\/4 tsp cumin seeds\r\n\r\n\u00c2\u00bd tsp split black gram (minappa pappu) - optional\r\n\r\n10-12 fresh curry leaves\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Pre-heat oil in a cooking vessel, add the mustard seeds and let them splutter.

Make a + slit with a knife at the base of each tomato and place in hot water for a few minutes and then de-skin and puree. If you dont have the black gram dal on hand, dont worry, its optional. If you dont have asafoetida on hand, you can replace it with 3-4 crushed garlic cloves which should be added at the time of tempering. You can use either green chillis or chilli pwd or both, according to your spice level. You can add more water if you want a more saucy consistency and have it as a soup.\r\n\r\n\r\n","image":"http:\/\/www.sailusfood.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/tomato-chutney.JPG","image-small":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/tomato-chutney-150x150.jpg","image-large":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/tomato-chutney-300x300.jpg","main-ingredient":["tomatoes"],"author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Ayurvedic Cooking - Ayurveda Recipes","Indian Chutney Recipes - Pachadi","Indian Vegan Recipes","Indian Vegetarian Recipes","Recipes Vegetable Dishes","South Indian Recipes"],"tags":["tomato","vegan_recipe"]}
