Other than the famous traditional Andhra Avakai (Mango Pickle), Andhra cuisine also boasts of an assortment of pachadis, one of them being Pachi Mamidikaya - Kobbari Pachadi.\r\n\r\nRaw Mango-Coconut Chutney, is a very simple recipe that is easy to make, healthy and flavorful. This authentic pachadi, one of Andhra\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s raw cuisine side dishes, is traditionally ground in a stone mortar and served with steamed white rice and ghee, tastes the best, the day its prepared unlike few other pachadis that have a longer shelf life.\r\n\r\nThis humble pachadi with a tangy-sweet flavor due to the mango and coconut and subtle spice taste of the green chillis, is prepared by grinding raw mango pieces with grated fresh coconut and green chillis and infused with a seasoning of mustard seeds, fresh curry leaves and asafoetida.\r\n\r\nCoconut Mango Chutney Recipe\r\nRecipe source: Amma\r\nPreparation: 15-20  mts\r\nServes 4-5 persons\r\nCuisine: Andhra\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\nIngredients:\r\n\r\n1 cup of freshly grated coconut (you can also cut the coconut into thin slices)\r\n\r\n\u00c2\u00bd cup fresh green raw mango pieces \u00e2\u20ac\u201c peeled (if the mango is too tangy reduce to \u00c2\u00bc cup)\r\n\r\n3-4 green chillies (increase or decrease to suit your spice level)- saute the green chillis in a tsp of oil for a few seconds\r\n\r\nsalt to taste\r\n\r\nFor tempering:\r\n\r\n1 tsp mustard seeds\r\n\r\n8-10 fresh curry leaves\r\n\r\nbig pinch asafoetida\r\n\r\n1 tsp oil\r\n\r\n3\/4 tsp split black gram (minappa pappu) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c (optional)\r\n\r\n1 dry red chilli (optional)\r\n\r\n  \r\n1 Grind the coconut, mango pieces, saut\u00c3\u00a9ed green chillies and salt to a coarse paste by adding little water.
