Its origins go back to a small town, Kundapur, close to Mangalore. You will find this exotic chicken dish on almost every Mangalore restaurant menu. Fiery red, tangy and spicy with an unmistakable flavor of ghee roasted spices, this authentic home style chicken dish is not for the faint heart. Definitely a cold weather favorite that is sure to warm your palate as well as your heart. :)\r\n\r\nMangalore Chicken Ghee Roast\r\n\r\nDo not skimp on the ghee as it is the flavor of clarified butter that gives the dish its distinct flavor. One of the best Mangalore recipes that I have tried. I served the Chicken ghee roast with Ghee rice and sambar. Made for a delectable mid day meal.","image":"http:\/\/www.sailusfood.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/12\/mangalore-chicken-ghee-roast.jpg","image-small":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/mangalore-chicken-ghee-roast-150x150.jpg","image-large":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/mangalore-chicken-ghee-roast-300x300.jpg","style":["easy","modern"],"course":["main-course"],"special-diet":["eggless","nut free","gluten free","non vegetarian","kid friendly","pregnancy"],"cuisine":["mangalorean"],"cook-time":"45","prep-time":"15","main-ingredient":["chicken","ghee"],"serves":"5","goes-well-with":["rice"],"author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Indian Chicken Recipes","Indian Fry Recipes","Indian Non-Vegetarian Recipes","Mangalorean Recipes"],"tags":["chicken","chicken-roast","mangalore-recipe"]}
