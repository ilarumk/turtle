Prepared pretty much the way one would prepare vermicelli\/semiya. Adding vegetables of your choice makes it substantial while tofu\/paneer adds a dose of protein. Sevai are a type of rice noodles popular in South India especially Tamil Nadu and Sevai preparations include coconut, lemon and tomato.\r\n\r\nVegetable Sevai Recipe\r\nPrep & Cooking Time: 20 mts\r\nServes 4 persons\r\nCuisine: South Indian\r\n.\r\n\r\nIngredients:\r\n\r\n2 cups instant rice sevai (I used MTR brand)\r\n\r\n1 finely sliced large onion\r\n\r\n3-4 slit green chillis\r\n\r\n1\" ginger finely chopped\r\n\r\npinch of asafoetida\/hing\/inguva\r\n\r\n1 tomato, chopped\r\n\r\n1 1\/2 cups diced and parboiled mixed vegetables (carrot, beans, green peas)\r\n\r\n1 tbsp chopped coriander leaves (optional)\r\n\r\n1\/2 tbsp oil\r\n\r\n1 tsp ghee (optional)\r\n\r\nsalt \r\n\r\nFor seasoning:\r\n\r\n1 tsp mustard seeds\r\n\r\n1\/2 tbsp split black gram\r\n\r\n1\/2\" cinnamon stick (optional)\r\n\r\n12-15 curry leaves\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Boil 4 cups of water and add the rice sevai along with 1\/4 tsp salt and 1 tsp oil. Once the sevai is cooked (it should be just soft and not mushy), turn off heat, pour into a colander to drain completely and and keep aside. The sevai cooks fast so watch out while its boiling.\r\n2 Heat oil and ghee in a cooking vessel, add the mustard seeds and let them splutter. Add the black gram and curry leaves and saute them till the dal turns slightly brown and a nice aroma emanates the kitchen. Add the asafoetida and mix.\r\n3 Add the sliced onions, green chillis and ginger and saute for 4 mts. Add the parboiled vegetables and green peas. Cook for 4 mts.\r\n4 Add the chopped tomatoes and saute on medium heat for 4 mts. \r\n5 Now, add the cooked sevai and and mix it lightly and see that no lumps form. Garnish with coriander leaves. Turn off heat.\r\n6 Serve hot with chutney or pickle of your choice.\r\n\r\nNote: For variation, garnish with grated coconut. You can added roasted cashews too. \r\n\r\n ","image":"http:\/\/www.sailusfood.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/04\/vegetable-sevai.jpg","image-small":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/vegetable-sevai-150x150.jpg","image-large":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/vegetable-sevai-300x300.jpg","style":["easy","traditional","quick"],"course":["breakfast","dinner"],"special-diet":["eggless","dairy free","vegan","nut free","vegetarian","kid friendly","pregnancy"],"cuisine":["south indian"],"cook-time":"20","prep-time":"5","main-ingredient":["rice sevai","vegetables"],"serves":"4","goes-well-with":["chutney","pickle"],"author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Chaat Recipes","Indian Breakfast Recipes","Indian Vegan Recipes","Indian Vegetarian Recipes","Recipes Vegetable Dishes","South Indian Recipes"],"tags":["rice sevai","vegetable-sevai"]}
