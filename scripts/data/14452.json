I am a faithful fan of brinjals aka eggplants and my blog is testimony to that. :)\r\n\r\nThese stuffed brinjals are soft and gooey with an aromatic stuffing that include fresh coconut, fresh coriander and cumin. The kitchen is filled with an incredible aroma as the baby brinjals roast over slow fire. I've always been a fresh coriander lover and its inclusion elevates this hearty Andhra stuffed brinjal recipe. In fact fresh coconut and coriander are the flavor boosters for this vegetarian dish. The key is in choosing the right kind of brinjals. Avoid the seedy bitter variety and go for tender, baby brinjals. \r\n\r\nThough the dish lacks in looks, it more than makes up in flavor :) All brinjal lovers, especially the ones who heart stuffed brinjals, will surely make this a staple.
