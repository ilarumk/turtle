Don't we all have a special place in our hearts for all the tradtional dishes that our grandmothers lovingly made for us? :) It was fascinating to watch my ammamma (maternal grandmother) cook Andhra vantalu (cooking) with effortless ease especially those recipes that required expertise and I relished Boorelu prepared by her. I have a soft spot for Boorelu (also called as Poornalu), a culinary gem from Andhra. A close cousin to this classic sweet dumpling is Pala Munjalu. Similar in looks to Boorelu, it differs in terms of flavor and texture of the outer covering. \r\n\r\nPala Munjalu is a deep fried sweet which has the same poornam (filling) that goes into Boorelu, a sweetened bengal gram mixture that is flavored with cardamom powder. Instead of coating the poornam in a batter made with black gram dal and rice for Boorelu, we enclose it in a rice flour dough that has been cooked in milk. An absolutely soft and melt in the mouth sweet recipe that you can serve your family as part of your Diwali festival food spread.\r\n\r\nHow to make Pala Munjalu","image":"http:\/\/www.sailusfood.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/11\/pala-munjalu-traditional-sweets.jpg","image-small":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/pala-munjalu-traditional-sweets-150x150.jpg","image-large":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/pala-munjalu-traditional-sweets-300x300.jpg","style":["easy","traditional"],"course":["dessert"],"special-diet":["eggless","nut free","dairy","vegetarian","kid friendly","pregnancy"],"cuisine":["andhra"],"cook-time":"15","prep-time":"60","main-ingredient":["rice flour","chana dal","jaggery"],"serves":"12","author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Andhra Recipes","Eggless Dessert Recipes","Festival Foods","Indian Festivals","Indian Sweets Recipes","Navratri Recipes","Sweet Dessert Recipes"],"tags":["andhra-recipes","festival_sweets"]}
