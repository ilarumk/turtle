I am always on the look out for fast and easy breakfast recipes for kids and corn savory muffins recipe fits the bill. They work great for breakfast, school snack and picnic food as well.  \r\n\r\nToday's savory muffins recipe uses plain flour but since I make them often for my son, I use half a cup each of plain flour and whole wheat flour and 1\/4 cup groud oats. I stock on corn and you will find a packet in my freezer at any given time and I also had some green peas to use up. So sweet corn kernels, green peas, green chili paste, coriander leaves and loads of cheese gave the muffins a lot of flavor. Soft, moist, cheesy and addictive. The variations are endless and few flavorful combinations that I usually make are spinach & corn\/roasted bell peppers & corn\/ sausages & eggs. \r\n\r\nSavoury Muffins for Breakfast","image":"http:\/\/www.sailusfood.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/07\/savoury-muffins-recipe.jpg","image-small":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/savoury-muffins-recipe-150x150.jpg","image-large":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/savoury-muffins-recipe-300x300.jpg","style":["easy","quick"],"course":["breakfast"],"special-diet":["eggless","nut free","vegetarian","kid friendly","pregnancy"],"cuisine":["western"],"cook-time":"18","prep-time":"10","main-ingredient":["flour","corn"],"serves":"12","author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Flour Recipes","Lunch Box Recipes"],"tags":["breakfast","eggless","eggless-baking","muffins"]}
