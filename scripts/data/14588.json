Yes, Diwali is round the corner and all those celebrating are gearing up for the festival of lights by preparing festive treats for family and friends. It is that time of the year when Mithai aka sweets are distributed among family and friends with much gusto. To add to your recipe repertorie, I present to you a quick and easy laddu recipe that is protein rich and delicious. Moong Dal Ladoo is a classic Indian sweet prepared with least effort. No fancy ingredients or elaborate and complicated techniques are required. Just four steps - roast, powder, mix and shape, its that simple!\r\n\r\nThis lentil based sweet is prepared in most parts of India. It is popular as pesara sunnaundalu in Andhra and pasi paruppu laddu in Tamil Nadu. You can make it with either yellow moong dal or whole green gram. I have prepared laddus with both the varieties of dals. Roasted and powdered moong dal can be made ahead and stored in an airtight container. \r\n\r\nGreen Moong Dal Laddu","image":"http:\/\/www.sailusfood.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/moong-dal-ladoo-recipe.jpg","image-small":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/moong-dal-ladoo-recipe-150x150.jpg","image-large":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/moong-dal-ladoo-recipe-300x300.jpg","style":["easy","quick","traditional"],"course":["dessert"],"special-diet":["eggless","nut free","dairy","vegetarian","kid friendly","pregnancy"],"cuisine":["indian"],"cook-time":"15","prep-time":"20","main-ingredient":["yellow moong dal","sugar"],"serves":"8","author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Festival Foods","Indian Festivals","Indian Sweets Recipes","Navratri Recipes","South Indian Recipes","Sweet Dessert Recipes"],"tags":["diwali-sweets","laddu","laddu-recipe","moong dal"]}
