This Diwali, I have for you, dear readers, Andhra style Dahi Vada aka Perugu Garelu (Aavadalu). They differ from North Indian style Dahi Vada in terms of the tempering and the use of green chilies and ginger. \r\n\r\nIts the same process as one would prepare Dahi Vada or Tamil style Thayir Vada. Prepare the vadas, soak in water\/buttermilk for a few minutes and pour a savory yogurt sauce (seasoned with spices), over the vadas. You can serve them at room temperature or chilled. Perugu Garelu recipe is a must make snack during festivals like Deepavali, at our home. You can serve it for breakfast or as a cold starter\/appetizer. Absolute melt in the mouth festive fare!\r\n\r\nPerugu Aavadalu\r\n\r\nDiwali Sweet Recipes\r\nDiwali Sweets","image":"http:\/\/www.sailusfood.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/11\/perugu-garelu-andhra-style.jpg","image-small":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/perugu-garelu-andhra-style-150x150.jpg","image-large":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/perugu-garelu-andhra-style-300x300.jpg","style":["easy","quick","traditional"],"course":["starter"],"special-diet":["eggless","nut free","vegetarian","kid friendly","pregnancy"],"cuisine":["Andhra"],"cook-time":"15","prep-time":"30","main-ingredient":["Black gram dal","Yogurt"],"serves":"4","author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Andhra Recipes","Festival Foods","Indian Breakfast Recipes","Indian Festivals","Indian Lentil Recipes","Indian Snacks and Starter Recipes","Indian Vegetarian Recipes","Navratri Recipes","South Indian Recipes"],"tags":["andhra-recipes","perugu-garelu"]}
