Its one of my favorite stir fry recipe. Since Nehal is not too fond of greens, the only way I get him to eat this stir fry is by using it as a sandwich filling, add grated cheese and make a sandwich using stove top sandwich toaster. Makes for a fabulous sandwich. :)\r\n\r\nPalakura Vepudu - Spinach Stir fry\r\n\r\nA simple, straight forward every day kind of recipe that you can be prepared in less than 20 mts.
