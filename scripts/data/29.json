There are numerous bajji wallas along the beach road that open during the evenings to serve the famous street foods - bajjis and murri mixture. You have mirchi ka bajjis  (mirapakaaya bajji) to spice things up a bit...:) but murri mixture is the most famous of them all.\r\n\r\nMurri mixture is a typical Andhra street food fare, a mix of puffed rice, onions, tomato, peanuts, lemon juice and lots of fresh coriander leaves (cilantro). Its tangy, lightly spicy.\r\n\r\nAndhra street food is a culinary tradition that most Andhras wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t dream of doing without. It includes sweets, bajjis, pakoras, snacks and breads sold on city streets. Street food here is a learning experience by itself, cooked right before your eyes, reassuring not only of the freshness of the food being made but also the ingredients that go into preparing it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat's Ramu my favorite bajji wala with his mobile bajji \/murri mixture stall..:)\r\n\r\nWhile many regions in India have their own versions of puffed rice mixture the most famous being the bhelpuri, the south indian version (andhra) is called murri mixture where puffed rice forms the base of the mixture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the puffed rice, add some finely chopped tomatoes, onions and green chillies or chilli pwd, coriander leaves, roasted peanuts, boiled chick peas, chopped mammidi allam (mango ginger- a excellent herb which is optional), salt and a dash of lime and mix it well.
