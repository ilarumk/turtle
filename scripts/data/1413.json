Makes a delectable combination with some appadams. I just realized that I havent blogged any stir fry chicken dishes. This chicken fry is the simplest ever that even a 10 year can prepare. Usually I cook the chicken in its own water till almost dry and in a separate vessel, stir fry the cooked chicken in garam masala and curry leaves. It requires less oil, quick and tasty.\r\n\r\n\r\nKodi Vepudu Recipe\r\nPrep & Cooking: 40 mts\r\nServes 4-5 persons\r\nCuisine: Andhra\r\n.\r\n\r\nIngredients:\r\n\r\n1 kg chicken, washed and cut into medium sized pieces\r\n\r\n1\/4 tsp turmeric\r\n\r\n1 1\/2 tsps chilli pwd\r\n\r\n1 tsp coriander powder\r\n\r\n1 tbsp ginger garlic paste\r\n\r\n1 onion, coarsely crushed\r\n\r\n1 tsp ghee\r\n\r\ngaram masala pwd (1\" dalchini, 1 elaichi and 4 cloves finely ground)\r\n\r\nfew curry leaves\r\n\r\n2 slit green chillis\r\n\r\nsalt to taste\r\n\r\n1 tbsp oil\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Mix the washed chicken with chilli pwd, coriander pwd, turmeric pwd, ginger garlic paste and ghee and keep aside for 5 mts. \r\n2 Add few tbsps water, crushed onion and salt to the marinated chicken and cook till the water has almost evaporated and the chicken turns soft. This could take approx 25-30 mts.\r\n 3 Heat oil in a cooking vessel, add curry leaves and green chillis and saute for a few seconds, add the cooked chicken along with any left over gravy and cook on high heat for 3 mts. Reduce flame to medium and sprinkle the garam masala pwd and saute further for another 2 mts.\r\n4 Serve hot with white steamed rice or rotis.","image":"http:\/\/www.sailusfood.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/11\/chicken-fry-bisi-bele-bath.jpg","image-small":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/chicken-fry-bisi-bele-bath-150x150.jpg","image-large":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/chicken-fry-bisi-bele-bath-300x300.jpg","main-ingredient":["chicken"],"author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Andhra Recipes","Indian Chicken Recipes","Indian Fry Recipes","Indian Non-Vegetarian Recipes"],"tags":["chicken","vepudu"]}
