Slit each gherkin into two, length wise, as shown in the picture and slice them into thin long strips. \r\n\r\n2 Heat a few drops of oil in a cooking vessel. Once the oil is hot, reduce heat to medium flame, add the cumin seeds and let them splutter and turn brown. Add the red chillis and fry for a few seconds stirring continuosly.

The taste is the same though, whether served immediately on cooking or after a couple of hours of cooking.\r\n5. Ivy gourds can be used raw in salads, steamed, curried, stuffed, pickled, stir-fried and deep fried.
