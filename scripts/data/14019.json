Thank you for all the wonderful feedback that I have been receiving on the Facebook fan page and here. Oats Pongal, a South Indian style healthy breakfast recipe, is sure to be well received by your loved ones. I added spinach along with yellow moong dal giving the Oats Pongal a wonderful flavor and not to mention, nutrition.\r\n\r\nIts a personal preference, I like to make the Oats Pongal a bit more creamy (read liquid-y) by adding more liquid during the cooking process. Just add 1\/2 cup of water in addition to the mentioned quantity of water in the recipe. Throw in some mixed vegetables and you have a one pot meal. I enjoy Oats Pongal when dunked in rasam or sambar rather than a chutney as a side. Its super comforting. :)\r\n\r\nPongal with Oats","image":"http:\/\/www.sailusfood.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/09\/breakfast-recipe-oats-pongal.jpg","image-small":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/breakfast-recipe-oats-pongal-150x150.jpg","image-large":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/breakfast-recipe-oats-pongal-300x300.jpg","style":["easy","quick","modern"],"course":["breakfast"],"special-diet":["eggless","gluten free","vegetarian","kid friendly","pregnancy"],"cuisine":["south indian"],"cook-time":"12","prep-time":"10","main-ingredient":["oats","moong dal"],"serves":"3","goes-well-with":["chutney","pickle","sambar"],"author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Andhra Recipes","Indian Breakfast Recipes","Lunch Box Recipes","South Indian Recipes"],"tags":["indian-recipes-with-oats","oats-pongal"]}
