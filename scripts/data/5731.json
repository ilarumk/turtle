Here in Vizag, we are enjoying the winter months. Pleasant cold weather calls for a comforting dal with hot rotis. I tried a different approach to prepare spinach and yellow moong dal away from the regular fare. I had a cup of coconut milk, left over, after preparing Poha Payasam which I decided to put to use. And it worked out nicely giving the dal a creamy texture and a rich flavor. A hearty bowl of dal with warm winter flavors. Delicious with warm rotis or hot rice.\r\n\r\nMoong Dal Palak\r\n\r\n\r\nMoong Dal Palak Recipe\r\nPreparation: 10 mts, Cooking: 30 mts\r\nServes 4-5 persons\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\nIngredients:\r\n\r\n1 small cup moong dal\/split yellow dal\/pesara pappu, cooked over stove top till soft\r\n\r\n2 cups chopped and tightly packed palakura\/palak\/spinach \r\n\r\n1 onion, chopped\r\n\r\n1 tomato, chopped\r\n\r\n1 tsp ginger-green chilli paste\r\n\r\n1\/2 tsp red chilli pwd\r\n\r\n1 tsp coriander pwd\r\n\r\npinch of cumin pwd\r\n\r\nbig pinch turmeric pwd\r\n\r\npinch of garam masala\r\n\r\nsalt to taste\r\n\r\n1\/2 cup thick coconut milk\r\n\r\n1 1\/2 cups water, approx\r\n\r\nFor seasoning\/poppu\/tadka:\r\n\r\n1\/2 tsp cumin seeds\r\n\r\npinch of hing\/asafoetida\/inguva\r\n\r\n1 tbsp ghee or oil\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 In a pressure cooker, add 1 1\/2 to 2 cups of water and moong dal and pressure cook upto 2 whistles.
