Quite a few readers tried the marble bundt cake recipe with eggs that I posted a couple of months ago and gave positive feedback. I modified the marble bundt cake recipe by replacing eggs with buttermilk (mixture of warm milk and apple cider vinegar) and banana puree and used oil instead of butter. \r\n\r\nEggless Marble Cake\r\n\r\nThe cake is not only visually appealing with the beautiful white and chocolate swirls but also appetizing with a moist and tender crumb. I did not adorn the cake but you can drizzle some ganache or chocolate syrup. A perfect cake to bake for a special occassion. I baked it to celebrate Sailu's Kitchen Facebook page surpassing half a million likes. :)\r\n","image":"http:\/\/www.sailusfood.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/eggless-marble-cake.jpg","image-small":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/eggless-marble-cake-150x150.jpg","image-large":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/eggless-marble-cake-300x300.jpg","style":["easy"],"course":["dessert"],"special-diet":["eggless","nut free","gluten","dairy","vegetarian","kid friendly","pregnancy"],"cuisine":["western"],"cook-time":"60","prep-time":"15","main-ingredient":["flour","sugar"],"serves":"12","goes-well-with":["coffee"],"author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Cake Recipes","Eggless Cake &amp; Cookie Recipes","Flour Recipes"],"tags":["eggless","eggless-baking","eggless-cake","marble-cake"]}
