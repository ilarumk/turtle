Senagapappu Payasam is a traditional South Indian sweet dish that I prepared for our Ugadi festive meal. This lentil based sweet dish incorporates the same ingredients that you'd find in a regular Payasam - jaggery, milk or coconut milk and cardamom powder. The star ingredient in today's recipe is chana dal (Bengal gram) along with sago.\r\n\r\nSenaga Pappu Bellam Payasam Recipe\r\nCooking Time: 45 mts\r\nCuisine: Andhra\r\nServes 5-6 persons\r\n. \r\n\r\nIngredients:\r\n\r\n1\/2 cup chana dal\/bengal gram, soak in water for 1\/2 hr, pressure cook upto 2 whistles (soft)\r\n\r\n3\/4 cup sago\/saggubiyyam\/sabudana, cook in 2 cups water till soft\r\n\r\n1 cup grated jaggery, soak in 1 cup strained chana dal water for 10 mts\r\n\r\n2 cups low fat milk\r\n\r\n1\/2 tsp cardamom pwd\r\n\r\n8-10 cashew nuts \r\n\r\nfew raisins\r\n\r\n1\/2 tbsp ghee\r\n\r\n1 Heat a pan, add ghee and toast the cashew nuts and raisins till golden brown.
