Knowing the immense health benefits soya offers in terms of nutrients, dietary protein and fibre, especially for growing children, I always look for ways to incorporate it in my toddlers diet. \r\n\r\nI learnt that to achieve the full potency of soya, its best to combine it with other foods and vegetables and it also ensures a complete balanced diet. While preparing the dough for rotis, I add a few tbsps of soya flour to the wheat flour and use soya chunks to prepare manchurian like chicken or vegetable manchurian. \r\n\r\nAnother way, I incorporate soya in the diet, is by preparing vegetable pulao using soya chunks, mixed vegetables and fried bread cubes. The first time I prepared this pulao, I was a bit weary about my toddler eating it, but to my relief, both father and son duo, asked for a second helping of this nutritious pulao. So Mama is happy to share this healthy rice dish with you today :)\r\n\r\nThis is also my entry to FMR #6 - For The Love Of Rice hosted by Paz.\r\n\r\n\r\n Soya Chunks Vegetable Pulao Recipe\r\nRecipe source: Own experiment\r\nPrep & Cooking: 45 mts, soaking of rice: 15 mts\r\nServes 6 persons\r\n.\r\n\r\nIngredients:\r\n\r\n3 cups basmati rice \u00e2\u20ac\u201c washed and soaked in water for 15 mts\r\n\r\n1 cup dried soya chunks - washed and boiled in water till soft\r\n\r\n2-3 tbsp ghee \r\n\r\n1 tsp shah jeera \r\n\r\n2 bay leaves\r\n\r\n2 big onions finely sliced\r\n\r\n1 tbsp grated ginger\r\n\r\n3-4 green chillies slit length wise\r\n\r\n1 cup chopped mixed vegetables like beans, green peas, carrots or potatoes\r\n\r\n\u00c2\u00bd tsp turmeric powder\r\n\r\nsalt to taste\r\n\r\n3-4 tbsps of fresh mint leaves (pudina)\r\n\r\n3 cups of freshly extracted coconut milk \r\n\r\n2 \u00c2\u00bd cups water\r\n\r\n2-3 tbsps lemon juice\r\n\r\nfresh coriander leaves for garnish\r\n\r\n3-4 bread slices (cubed and lightly fried in ghee) - optional\r\n\r\n8-10 cashewnuts (lightly roasted in ghee till golden brown) \r\n\r\nFor Masala Powder (lightly dry roast in a pan and grind to a fine pwd)\r\n\r\n2 green cardamoms\r\n\r\n4 cloves\r\n\r\n2\u00e2\u20ac\u009d cinnamom stick\r\n\r\n3-4 pepper corns\r\n\r\n1\/4 tsp fennel seeds (optional)\r\n\r\n1 tsp coriander seeds\r\n\r\n1\/2 tsp cumin seeds\r\n\r\n1-2 dry red chillis  \r\n \r\n1 Heat ghee in a heavy bottomed vessel.

You can increase the use of green chillis, cloves, pepper and dry red chillis, if you want a spicer pulao. I have used less spice to suit my toddler's palate. If you dont have a coconut on hand, replace the coconut milk with water, but the flavor of pulao will differ.
