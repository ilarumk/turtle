A stand-out recipe where cabbage is mildly spiced with red chilli, cumin and coriander powders and garnished with fresh coriander leaves. One of my favorites as a side to go with rice, rasam and appadam. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCabbage Vepudu Recipe\r\nPrep & Cooking: 25 mts\r\nServes 3-4 persons\r\nAndhra\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\nIngredients:\r\n\r\n3 cups chopped cabbage\r\n\r\n1 onion, very finely chopped\r\n\r\n1\/4 tsp turmeric pwd\r\n\r\n1 tsp chilli pwd (adjust)\r\n\r\n1\/2 tsp coriander pwd\r\n\r\nbig pinch cumin pwd\r\n\r\n1 tbsp chopped coriander leaves\r\n\r\nsalt to taste\r\n\r\n2-3 tsps oil\r\n\r\nFor seasoning\/poppu\/tadka:\r\n\r\n1\/2 tsp cumin seeds\r\n\r\n2 cloves garlic, crushed\r\n\r\nfew fresh curry leaves\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Par-boil cabbage with pinch of turmeric and salt to taste.
