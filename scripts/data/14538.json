Steamed marble sized rice flour balls are tossed in a tempering of spices which include asafoetida and aromatic curry leaves. In Andhra, it goes by the name Undrallu Guggillu or Talimpu Undrallu similar to Talimpu Senagalu. Usually, left over undrallu rice flour dough is used to prepare this kara aka savory style dish. I must mention that shaping the dough into small sized balls is a time consuming process. But definitely worth the effort. \r\n\r\nThese are best prepared with home made rice flour which yields a soft kozhukattai. Often store bought flour yields tough rice flour balls on steaming. They make for a low fat evening snack or a light meal. Just mix some spicy karam podi or idli milagai podi over the hot Ammini Kozhukattai, toss well and eat when warm. Highly addictive, I tell you. :) Vegans can omit ghee and use oil.\r\n\r\nTempered steamed rice flour balls ~ Undrallu Guggillu\r\n\r\nVinayaka Chavithi Recipes\r\nUndrallu\r\nPaala Undrallu\r\nUppu Kudumulu\r\nBiyyam Rava Kudumulu\r\nPulihora ~ Andhra Tamarind Rice\r\nGarelu (Vada)\r\nPayasam\r\nKajjikayalu","image":"http:\/\/www.sailusfood.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/undrallu-guggillu.jpg","image-small":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/undrallu-guggillu-150x150.jpg","image-large":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/undrallu-guggillu-300x300.jpg","style":["easy","traditional"],"course":["starter"],"special-diet":["eggless","nut free","dairy free","gluten free","vegetarian","vegan","kid friendly","pregnancy"],"cuisine":["tamil nadu"],"cook-time":"20","prep-time":"30","main-ingredient":["rice flour"],"serves":"5","author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Andhra Recipes","Festival Foods","Indian Festivals","Indian Snacks and Starter Recipes","Indian Vegan Recipes","Indian Vegetarian Recipes","South Indian Recipes"],"tags":["kozhukattai","rice flour","talimpu","undrallu"]}
