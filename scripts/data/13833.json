We celebrated Valentine's Day with a wonderfully decadent chocolate dessert. Molten Lava Chocolate Cake - a perfect Valentine Day's treat! Its ridiculously easy, quick to make and chocolate-y. Mini warm chocolate cake with oozing, flowing chocolate similar to molten lava.\r\n\r\nMolten Lava Chocolate Cake\r\n\r\nMy mini cakes had more than required gooey chocolate lava, not that I do not like them that way. The next time I make them, I will reduce the espresso liquid and up the flour quantity a bit. Yes, I made an espresso version as I love the concoction of espresso and chocolate in these petite cakes. Isn't chocolate beautiful is all its avatars?\r\n\r\nMolten Lava Cake before baking","image":"http:\/\/www.sailusfood.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/02\/molten-lava-chocolate-cake.jpg","image-small":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/molten-lava-chocolate-cake-150x150.jpg","image-large":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/molten-lava-chocolate-cake-300x300.jpg","style":["easy","quick","modern"],"course":["dessert"],"special-diet":["egg","dairy","gluten","kid friendly"],"cuisine":["Western"],"cook-time":"13","prep-time":"15","main-ingredient":["Chocolate","Eggs"],"serves":"3","goes-well-with":["Ice cream"],"author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Cake Recipes","Sweet Dessert Recipes"],"tags":["chocolate","molten-lava-cake"]}
