There is something about langar food at our local Gurudwara that is almost magical, not only is it deeply satisfying but you leave the holy place with a certain feel good factor. It is difficult to recreate the same flavors at home though it is simple, wholesome and humble khana, the dal sabzi and roti fare. I have deepest respect for the Sikh tradition of food charity (langar) for all, irrespective of caste or creed, rich or poor and upholding the values of equality (oneness of all human beings) service and brotherhood.\r\n\r\nThe chownk or tarka, the final sizzling garnish, where spices are fried in ghee until aromatic and mixed into the creamy Langarwali dal just before serving gives the dal a unique and smoky flavor. A comforting rich Punjabi dal recipe that goes best with hot rotis\/pulkas.","image":"http:\/\/www.sailusfood.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/11\/amritsari-dal.jpg","image-small":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/amritsari-dal-150x150.jpg","image-large":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/amritsari-dal-300x300.jpg","style":["easy","traditional"],"course":["side"],"special-diet":["eggless","nut free","gluten","dairy","vegetarian","kid friendly","pregnancy"],"cuisine":["punjabi"],"cook-time":"45","prep-time":"15","main-ingredient":["black lentils","chana dal","tomatoes"],"serves":"6","goes-well-with":["roti"],"author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Indian Dal Recipes","Indian Lentil Recipes","Indian Vegetarian Recipes","North Indian Recipes"],"tags":["dal","easy-vegetarian-recipes","punjabi recipes"]}
