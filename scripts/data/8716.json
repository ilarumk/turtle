Eagerly awaiting the onset of monsoon and if the weather forecast is to be trusted, its just 2-3 days away, making way for comforting, deep fried foods. :)\r\n\r\nOn a hot day like today, there is nothing more refreshing than a chilled yogurt based drink. Prepared a smoothie using chilled homemade curd, fresh mint leaves and cucumber. Quick, easy and a healthy way to get calcium into your diet.\r\n\r\nBlend 1\/2 cup of peeled and diced cucumber, 2-3 fresh mint leaves, few ice cubes, 1 1\/2 cups thick low fat yogurt, few tbsps of water (for a thinner consistency) and pinch of chaat masala powder or black salt. Pour into glasses and serve cold.","image":"http:\/\/www.sailusfood.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/04\/cucumber-yogurt-smoothie.jpg","image-small":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/cucumber-yogurt-smoothie-150x150.jpg","image-large":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/cucumber-yogurt-smoothie-300x300.jpg","style":["easy","modern","quick"],"course":["appetizer"],"special-diet":["nut free","eggless","vegetarian","dairy","kid friendly","pregnancy"],"cuisine":["indian"],"cook-time":"0","prep-time":"10","main-ingredient":["yogurt","cucumber"],"serves":"2","author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Indian Drink - Sharbat Recipes","Indian Milk Recipes","Indian Vegetarian Recipes","Recipes Vegetable Dishes"],"tags":["cucumber","smoothie","yogurt"]}
