The festivities began yesterday with a lot of feasting. Pulihora, garelu, halwa boorelu, bobbatlu, cauliflower masala curry, potato fry, kakarakaya (bitter gourd) nilava pachadi, charu, appadam and yogurt with white rice was the lunch menu for 'Bhogi' (first day of the festival). \r\n\r\nRibbon Murukkulu with Tea\r\n\r\nOver the weekend we prepared two traditional savory preparations ~ Ribbon murukkulu and Chegodilu. Ribbon Murukku is prepared from Jantikalu dough that is deep fried using the ribbon disc of the jantikalu gottam. I have already blogged Jantikalu recipe and you can follow that recipe to prepare Ribbon Murukkulu.\r\n\r\nPearls of Wisdom ~ When you notice something good about someone, compliment them. Even if you have said it many times before, say it again. Don't worry that others will get tired of receiving appreciation - nobody does.","image":"http:\/\/www.sailusfood.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/01\/ribbon-murukku1.jpg","image-small":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/ribbon-murukku1-150x150.jpg","image-large":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/ribbon-murukku1-300x300.jpg","main-ingredient":["rice flour"],"author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Andhra Recipes","Chaat Recipes","Festival Foods"],"tags":["murukku"]}
