After a couple of trials, I have settled with this recipe. The secret to a flavorful Chicken Manchurian is the use of chicken stock. Marinated boneless chicken is deep fried and the golden balls are tossed with a cornflour based ginger-garlic concoction and garnished with a generous amount of spring onion greens. Serve hot to savor the true flavor of this Indo Chinese starter.\r\n\r\nChicken Manchurian\r\n\r\nChicken Manchurian Recipe\r\nMarination: 1 hr, Prep & Cooking: 45 mts\r\nServes: 5 persons\r\nCuisine: Indo-Chinese\r\n.\r\n\r\nIngredients:\r\n\r\n1\/4 kg boneless chicken, cut into fine pieces \r\n\r\n6-7 tbsps spring onion whites\r\n\r\n3-4 tbsps spring onion greens\r\n\r\n1\/2 tbsp chopped garlic\r\n\r\n1\/2 tbsp chopped ginger\r\n\r\n2 tsps soya sauce\r\n\r\n1 tbsp chilli sauce\r\n\r\n2 tsps vinegar\r\n\r\n1 tbsp corn flour + 5 tbsps chicken stock or water\r\n\r\n1\/2 tsp brown sugar\r\n\r\n2 tbsps tomato sauce\r\n\r\n1\/2 tsp red chilli pwd (preferably Kashmiri)\r\n\r\nsalt to taste\r\n\r\n1 1\/2 tbsps sesame oil\r\n\r\noil for deep frying\r\n\r\nFor marinade: (marinate chicken with below ingredients for at least 15 mts or 1 hr)\r\n\r\n1\/4 tsp pepper pwd\r\n\r\n1 egg white\r\n\r\nsalt to taste\r\n\r\n1 1\/2 tsps ginger-garlic-green chilli paste\r\n\r\n1\/2 tsp soy sauce\r\n\r\n1 tbsp maida\/all purpose flour\r\n\r\n2-3 tbsps corn flour \r\n\r\n1-2 tbsps of water, if required\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Heat oil in a heavy bottomed vessel, make small balls of the marinated chicken and carefully drop into the hot oil.
