Many a time its just a very small portion that is left and there is nothing much that can prepared with it except chutney. Today was one such day when there was just enough sorakaya aka lauki and a perfect way to use it up by way of this unassuming pachadi which features a generous dose of roasted lentils and some tamarind. I like to add fresh coriander to incorporate a slightly herby flavor.\r\nSorakaya Pachadi\r\n\r\nSorakaya Pachadi Recipe\r\nPrep & Cooking: 25 mts\r\nServes 4-5 persons\r\nCuisine: Andhra\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\nIngredients:\r\n\r\n1 1\/2 cups bottle gourd cubes, with skin\r\n\r\n1\/2 tbsp bengal gram\/senaga pappu\/chana dal\r\n\r\n1\/2 tbsp split gram dal\/minappa pappu\r\n\r\n1\/2 tsp cumin seeds\r\n\r\n1 tsp coriander seeds (optional)\r\n\r\n1 tbsp chopped coriander leaves (optional)\r\n\r\n2 dry red chillis, de-seed\r\n\r\n3 green chillis, chop each into two \r\n\r\n4-5 garlic cloves\r\n\r\n1 tsp jaggery or sugar\r\n\r\ngooseberry sized tamarind (soaked in 2-3 tbsps warm water)\r\n\r\nsalt to taste\r\n\r\n3 tsps oil\r\n\r\nFor seasoning\/poppu\/tadka:\r\n\r\n1\/4 tsp mustard seeds\r\n\r\n1\/2 tsp black gram dal\r\n\r\n1-2 dry red chillis\r\n\r\nfew fresh curry leaves\r\n\r\n1\/2 tsp oil\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Heat 3 tsps oil in a cooking vessel, add bengal gram, split gram dal, cumin seeds and coriander seeds and stir fry for 3 mts or till the dals turn red.
