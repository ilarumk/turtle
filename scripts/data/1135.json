One of my best-loved meals is a coconut flavored aromatic rice with a creamy potato curry - Kobbari annam and Aloo kurma. The combination of flavors, the richness, sweetness and aroma makes the meal immensely flavorful and deeply satisfying. The fragrant coconut rice is rich and marginally sweet with green chillis adding a touch of spice. The creamy Aloo kurma is lightly spiced and a paste made of poppy seeds and coconut provides depth, texture and taste to the curry. A delectable combination that can be rustled up in under an hour!\r\n\r\nKobbari Annam ~ Coconut Rice\r\n\r\nKobbari Annam Recipe\r\nRecipe source: Amma\r\nPrep & Cooking: 30 mts\r\nServes 4-5 persons\r\n","image":"http:\/\/www.sailusfood.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/08\/kobbari_annam.jpg","image-small":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/kobbari_annam-150x150.jpg","image-large":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/kobbari_annam-300x300.jpg","main-ingredient":["coconut","rice"],"author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Andhra Recipes","Indian Curry Recipes","Indian Rice recipes","Indian Vegan Recipes"],"tags":["aloo","coconut","features","kobbari","potato"]}
