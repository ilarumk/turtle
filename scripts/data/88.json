Well,if your down with a stomach problem you would prefer to eat this dal as its very gentle on the stomach and is recommended for mucus dominated persons (Kapha dosha).We use this dal a lot in our everyday cooking be it as a dal with rice or rotis or combined with greens as a stir fry dish like Thotakura Pesara Pappu or to prepare our traditional sweet Bobattu aka Puran Poli.\r\n\r\nIt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the tempering\/seasoning which is the most important part of this golden yellow dal which gives it the perfect flavor and its aroma is further enhanced with the usage of ghee.This dal is infused with turmeric which provides a warm flavour other than imparting a golden color while cumin, ginger,asafetida,red and green chilli peppers aid in digestion of dal ,thus, transforming this dish into a truly tantilising everyday Indian dal.\r\n\r\nIngredients:\r\n\r\n1 cup split moong dal(pesara pappu) cooked in a pot with 3 cups of water(this dal cooks really fast unlike other dals)\r\n1 tsp cumin seeds\r\n2 green chilli slit length wise\r\n2 dry red chillis deseed and tear into pieces\r\n1 tsp grated ginger\r\n10 curry leaves\r\n1\/4 tsp turmeric (pasupu,haldi)\r\nbig pinch asafoetida (hing)\r\nsalt to taste\r\nghee\r\n1 tbsp lemon juice\r\n\r\nHeat 1 tbsp ghee in a vessel.Add the cumin seeds and let them sizzle and brown.\r\nNow add red chillis,green chillis,curry leaves,ginger and fry for a few seconds.\r\nNow add the asafoetida and turmeric and immediately add the cooked dal along with the excess boiled dal water.Add salt.\r\nLet the dal simmer for 8-10 mts.Turn off heat.\r\nJust before serving add a dash of lime and serve hot with steamed rice or rotis or have it as a soup.(If you wish to have it as a hot soup add an extra cup of water)\r\n\r\nFood,Food Blogs,Indian Recipes,Andhra Recipes,South Indian Cooking, Flickr\r\n\r\nChawal Ki Roti & Palak Makki (Rice Based Flat Bread & Spinach Corn Curry)\r\n\r\n\r\nComing up with nutritious,tasty wholesome meals for my family ,keeping in mind we have a growing child, has always been a challenge to me.I always look for interesting ways (read it as varieties)to conjure up a healthy meal loaded with greens (iron), vegetables (which provide the necessary nutrients),lentils and pulses(protein), whole grains (vital vitamins and minerals) and of course herbs and spices(nutritive and medicinal value) which not only provide natural health benefits but also titillate our taste buds..:).\r\n\r\nI try my best to influence the wellness level of my family in choosing a wide variety of fresh foods for balanced nutrition and combining and balancing their tastes and flavors with my cooking.Mostly I rely on the safe,tried and tested techniques utilised to bring out the best of flavours from the ingredients used, which I have picked up from amma and ammamma over time.Everyday is a learning process,adapting and learning from others,with most meals being satisfactory by striking a good mix of different tastes, sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent and astringent. According to Ayurveda each taste has a balancing effect, and including some of each minimizes cravings and balances the appetite and digestion.\r\n\r\nIndian cuisine has an eclectic collection of leavened and unleavened Indian breads which are so versatile and can be prepared according to one\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s taste and imagination be it the plain roti\/chapatti,stuffed rotis or paranthas or puris. Today I prepared nutritious Rice Rotis or Chawal Ki Roti prepared from cooked rice,rice flour,yogurt,methi leaves,ginger and green chillis (very rich in iron and carbohydrates).The rice,yogurt and chillis provide a sweet and spicy earthiness to the rotis while the greens (coriander and methi leaves) add a punch of bitter to offset the sweet.\r\n\r\nThe subtely spiced curry accompanying the rotis is Spinach(Palak) Corn prepared as the name suggests with spinach,corn,green chillis,ginger,garlic,mango powder and cream.The curry dish offsets the rich flavor of fresh cream and cashewnuts with the sweet-tangy flavour of corn and mango powder\u00e2\u20ac\u201c creating a unique balance.In short,a healthy meal spiced with a myriad of flavours to scintilate your taste buds.\r\n\r\nRice Rotis\r\nIngredients:\r\n\r\n1 cup rice flour (biyam pindi,chawal ka atta)\r\n1 cup cooked rice\r\n1 tbsp grated ginger\r\n1 tbsp chopped green chillies\r\n2 tbsp chopped coriander leaves\r\n2 tbsp fresh methi leaves (fenugreek)optional\r\n4 tbsps curd\r\n1 tbsp oil\r\nsalt to taste\r\nwater as required\r\n\r\nCombine all the ingredients and knead into a firm dough (use little water).\r\nDivide the dough into big lemon sized balls.\r\nRoll out each portion into a circle  of approx 6\" diameter and 1\/4\" thickness.\r\nHeat a griddle and cook each roti on both sides until brown ensuring that the edges are cooked on the inside too.Smear with ghee (clarified butter) and serve hot.\r\n\r\nPalak Makki\r\nIngredients:\r\n\r\n1 big bunch spinach\r\n1\/2 cup boiled corn kernels\r\n1\/2 tsp shahjeera (cumin seeds)\r\n1 medium onion finely chopped\r\n2 green chillis\r\n1\/2 tsp ginger garlic paste\r\n1\/4 tsp amchur pwd(dry mango pwd)\r\n1 tbsp cashewnut pwd\r\n1 tbsp fresh cream\r\nbig pinch of kasturi methi (dry fenugreek)\r\n1 tsp lemon juice\r\n\r\nBlanche spinach and puree it.\r\nHeat 1 tbsp oil in a vessel and add shahjeera.Let it sizzle.\r\nNow add finely chopped onions and fry well till oil seperates.Add the slit green chillis and ginger garlic paste and fry further for another 3-4 mts.\r\nAdd the palak paste and boiled corn and simmer covered for 3 mts.\r\nAdd amchur pwd,cashewnut pwd and salt and mix well.Add 1\/4 cup of water and cook\r\nfor a few minutes till you get the desired curry consistency.Towards the end add kasturi methi and turn off heat.Add the lemon juice and mix well.\r\nGarnish with fresh cream.\r\n\r\nFood,Food Blogs,Indian Recipes,Indian Cooking, Flickr","main-ingredient":["moong dal"],"author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Andhra Recipes","Indian Dal Recipes","Indian Soup Recipes","Indian Vegetarian Recipes"]}
