I love the combination of flavors in today's stuffed ridge gourd recipe. Nutty sesame seeds, coconut and tangy tamarind are the secret weapons that lend that perfect flavor to the curry. Those allergic to peanuts can substitute with melon seeds or cashew nuts. Serve along with warm rice for a filling and hearty meal.\r\n\r\nStuffed Ridge Gourd\r\n\r\nGutti Beerakaya Kura Recipe\r\nPrep & Cooking: 45 mts \r\nServes: 4-5 persons\r\nCuisine: Andhra\r\n.\r\n\r\nIngredients:\r\n\r\n300 gms ridge gourds (beerakaya), peeled, cut into 1 1\/2\" pieces, make a + slit on top for stuffing\r\n\r\n1 onion, finely chopped\r\n\r\n1\/4 tsp turmeric powder\r\n\r\n1 tsp mustard seeds\r\n\r\nfew curry leaves\r\n\r\n1\/2 tsp hing\/inguva\/asafoetida\r\n\r\n1 1\/4 tbsps tamarind paste\r\n\r\n1 tbsp roasted sesame seeds powder\r\n\r\n1 1\/2 tbsps oil\r\n\r\nchopped coriander leaves for garnish\r\n\r\nFor stuffing:\r\n\r\n2 tbsps grated fresh coconut paste\r\n\r\n2 tsps sambar powder\r\n\r\n1\/2 tsp saunf\/aniseed powder\r\n\r\n1 1\/2 tsps green chili-ginger paste\r\n\r\n1 tbsp roasted ground nut powder\r\n\r\n1\/4 tsp salt\r\n\r\n1 tsp grated jaggery (optional)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Take a tbsp of the paste and stuff each of the slit ridge gourd pieces. \r\n2 Heat oil in a vessel, add the mustard seeds and allow them to splutter.
