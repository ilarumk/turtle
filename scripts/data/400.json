Here are pictures of water melons being sold at the farmers market, rythu bazaar, in my city, Vishakhapatnam aka Vizag. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWater melons at the farmers market (rythu bazaar)\r\n\r\nNews from the food blogging world\r\n\r\n~ Indira of Mahanandi has started a food bloggers community website at Dining Hall for active food bloggers who would like to exchange and learn some tips and discuss food blogging related issues. I think its a wonderful idea to start a forum where we, food bloggers, can meet to expand our culinary knowledge and share with one another the nitty-gritty of food blogging. I sincerely hope that this forum would be a place where the food blog community can offer support and friendship and develop a sense of community.
