There are many variations to the kootu masala based on the region it is prepared. \r\n\r\nCauliflower Kootu is a classic vegan curry featuring cauliflower, tur dal, coconut, tamarind and a mix of spices like coriander, black pepper and lentils that form the kootu masala. These simple ingredients make for a fresh hotpot packed with nutrition and flavor. Tamarind is the key ingredient that gives this South Indian vegetarian curry a slightly sweet-sour flavor that is balanced with the earthy kootu masala. I have added mixed vegetables like potato, carrot and green peas for boost the nutrition profile of the kootu. Kootu is usually best served with rice but you can serve the left overs with dosa or chapati. :)\r\n\r\nOur lunch ~ Cauliflower kootu, beans velluli karam, sun dried tomato pickle, sun dried chilies and gummadi vadiyalu","image":"http:\/\/www.sailusfood.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/cauliflower-curry-vegan.jpg","image-small":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/cauliflower-curry-vegan-150x150.jpg","image-large":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/cauliflower-curry-vegan-300x300.jpg","style":["easy","modern"],"course":["side"],"special-diet":["eggless","nut free","gluten free","dairy free","vegetarian","vegan","kid friendly","pregnancy"],"cuisine":["tamil nadu"],"cook-time":"40","prep-time":"20","main-ingredient":["cauliflower"],"serves":"5","goes-well-with":["rice"],"author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Indian Curry Recipes","Indian Vegan Recipes","Indian Vegetarian Recipes","Recipes Vegetable Dishes","South Indian Recipes","Vegetable"],"tags":["cauliflower","indian_vegan_recipe","kootu","vegan"]}
