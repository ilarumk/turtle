And more so during the monsoon as this piping hot comfort soup soothes the soul. There are numerous versions of this simple soup and one of my favorite is an exotic South Indian delicacy, Pineapple Rasam. Refreshing ripe pineapple is put to good use in a spiced rasam to yield well balanced flavors - a tangy, sweet and and spicy rasam.\r\n\r\n\r\n Pineapple Rasam Recipe\r\nPreparation: 25-30 mts\r\nServes 4-5 persons\r\nCuisine: South Indian\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\nIngredients:\r\n\r\n1\/4 cup cooked tur dal\/red gram dal\/kandi pappu \r\n\r\n1 tomato, chopped or pureed\r\n\r\n1\/4 tsp turmeric pwd\r\n\r\n1-2 green chilies, slit\r\n\r\n1 1\/2 tsps home made rasam powder\r\n\r\n1\/4 cup pineapple puree\r\n\r\n2 pineapple slices, cut into 1\" pieces\r\n\r\n1 tsp jaggery or sugar\r\n\r\nfew fresh curry leaves\r\n\r\nsalt to taste\r\n\r\n3 1\/2 cups water\r\n\r\nFor seasoning\/poppu\/tadka:\r\n\r\n1\/2 tsp mustard seeds\r\n\r\n1\/2 tsp cumin seeds\r\n\r\npinch of asafoetida\/hing\/inguva\r\n\r\nfew fresh curry leaves\r\n\r\n2 tsps ghee\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Heat a deep vessel, add 3 1\/2 cups of water, mashed dal, chopped tomato, pineapple pieces, salt, turmeric pwd, green chilies, few fresh curry leaves, jaggery and rasam pwd and bring to a boil.
