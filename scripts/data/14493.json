Breakfast dishes which need elaborate preparation usually are reserved for holidays and weekends. \r\n\r\nSemiya Pulao is one such recipe that requires a bit of preparation and is reserved for the weekends. There are many Semiya recipes that serve as great tiffin items for kids and each time I try to make an attempt to try something different. But few semiya recipes like Semiya Pulao will always remain a favorite. Very similar to how one would go about making a vegetable pulao except that rice is substituted with roasted vermicelli. Ghee aka clarified butter is an important ingredient during the tempering process along with fresh mint leaves and spices like cardamom, cloves, cinnamon and fennel seeds that give the semiya pulao an irresistible aroma and flavor that is beyond words. \r\n\r\nSemiya Recipes ~ Vermicelli Pulao","image":"http:\/\/www.sailusfood.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/easy-to-cook-recipes-semiya.jpg","image-small":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/easy-to-cook-recipes-semiya-150x150.jpg","image-large":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/easy-to-cook-recipes-semiya-300x300.jpg","style":["easy","quick","modern"],"course":["breakfast"],"special-diet":["eggless","nut free","dairy","vegetarian","kid friendly","pregnancy"],"cuisine":["indian"],"cook-time":"30","prep-time":"15","main-ingredient":["semiya","mixed vegetables"],"serves":"4","goes-well-with":["raita"],"author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Indian Breakfast Recipes","Indian Vegetarian Recipes","Lunch Box Recipes","Recipes Vegetable Dishes","South Indian Recipes"],"tags":["semiya","semiya pulao","vermicelli"]}
