Remember the no bake chocolate cheesecake that I blogged earlier? My family and I relished it with great gusto but it pales in comparison to today's sweet treat that is completely vegetarian. I guess, its the flavor of  blueberries that has enamored me. :)\r\n\r\nSince fresh blueberries aren't available in my part of the world, I used blueberry preserve. The visually stunning cheesecake has a silky smooth mouth feel and the blueberry flavor is perfectly balanced with the sourness of the cream cheese. Perfect taste, texture and consistency! Definitely worth giving it a go since this no bake cheesecake is eggless, doesn't require an oven, uses agar agar and is a breeze to prepare. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d suggest you make this recipe using Philadelphia cream cheese. I find Britannia cream cheese too salty. If you cannot source cream cheese, you can use home made hung yogurt or silken tofu as a substitute. To prepare hung yogurt, take two cups of yogurt\/curd and place it in a sieve for a couple of hours to let the water drain. Use the drained water to knead chapati dough and use the hung curd in place of cream cheese. \r\n\r\nNo Bake Blueberry Cheesecake","image":"http:\/\/www.sailusfood.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/blueberry-cheesecake-recipe.jpg","image-small":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/blueberry-cheesecake-recipe-150x150.jpg","image-large":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/blueberry-cheesecake-recipe-300x300.jpg","style":["easy","modern"],"course":["dessert"],"special-diet":["eggless","nut free","gluten","dairy","vegetarian","kid friendly","pregnancy"],"cuisine":["western"],"cook-time":"5","prep-time":"30","main-ingredient":["blueberries","cream cheese"],"serves":"8","author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Eggless Dessert Recipes","Fruit Recipes","Sweet Dessert Recipes"],"tags":["blueberry","cheesecake","eggless"]}
