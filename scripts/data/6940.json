Similar to Crispy Dondakaya (Ivy Gourd\/Tindora), that was appreciated by many of you dear readers, but with a slight variation. Makes for a very good side with rice and rasam or sambar. The beans pakodi are delicious on their own, but when tossed in the curry leaves infused seasoning, intensifies the flavor making it addictive. I added a dash of coriander powder towards the end for extra oomph. :)\r\n\r\n\r\nBeans Pakodi Kura Recipe\r\nRecipe Source: Amma\r\nPrep: 30 mts\r\nServes: 4 persons\r\n.\r\n\r\nIngredients:\r\n\r\n\r\n250 gms \/1\/4 kg French beans, cut into 1\/2\" pieces\r\n\r\noil for deep frying\r\n\r\nFor coating\/batter:\r\n\r\n1 tbsp corn flour\r\n\r\n2 tbsps besan\/chick pea flour\/sengapindi\r\n\r\n1\/2 tsp ginger garlic paste\r\n\r\nsalt to taste\r\n\r\n1\/4 tsp red chilli pwd\r\n\r\nSeasoning\/Tadka\/Poppu:\r\n\r\n2-3 tsps oil\r\n\r\n1\/2 tsp finely minced ginger\r\n\r\n3\/4 tsp finely minced garlic\r\n\r\n2 green chillis, finely chopped\r\n\r\n2 sprigs fresh curry leaves\r\n\r\n1 small onion, finely chopped\r\n\r\npinch of red chilli pwd\r\n\r\n3\/4 tsp coriander pwd\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Wash french beans, nip the ends.
