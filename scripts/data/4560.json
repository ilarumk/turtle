Vindaloo is roughly translated from Portuguese as 'wine, vinegar and garlic'. \r\n\r\nChicken Vindaloo\r\n\r\nA favorite at our dining table. Cannot get enough of it each time I prepare this thick dark colored saucy dish. A perfect balance of spicy, tangy and sweet flavors. A hint of sweetness from jaggery and caramalized onions and the sourness of vinegar melds with the fiery red chillis and spices to exude a flavor that is drool worthy. Its the caramalized onions which gives the dish its dark color.\r\n\r\nGoan Chicken Vindaloo Recipe\r\nRecipe source: My recipe files\r\nPrep: 20 mts, Cooking Time: 30 mts\r\nServes 5-6 persons\r\nCuisine: Goan\r\n.\r\n\r\nIngredients:\r\n\r\n1 kg chicken, washed and cut into bite size pieces\r\n\r\n2 large onions, sliced, sauteed in a tbsp of oil till caramalized, cool and make paste\r\n\r\n1 tbsp ginger-garlic paste \r\n\r\n1 tsp mustard seeds\r\n\r\n1 tbsp coriander powder\r\n\r\n1\/4 tsp turmeric pwd\r\n\r\n4 tbsps vinegar + 1 tsp grated jaggery or brown sugar (let it sit for 15 mts)\r\n\r\nsalt to taste\r\n\r\n2 tbsps oil\r\n\r\nMake a paste: add a few tbsps of water\r\n\r\n3\/4 tsp roasted methi seeds\/fenugreek seeds\/menthulu\r\n\r\n1 tsp roasted cumin seeds\/jeera\r\n\r\n1 tsp pepper corns\r\n\r\n6-7 dry red chillis, lightly roasted\r\n\r\n1 1\/2\" cinnamon\/dalchini\r\n\r\n2 elaichi\/cardamom\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Heat oil in a cooking vessel, add mustard seeds and as they sizzle, add ginger garlic paste and fry for 2 mts.\r\n 2 Add coriander pwd, turmeric pwd and salt.
