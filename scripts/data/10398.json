Prepared a rice dish on the lines of tamarind rice and use sorrel leaves as the main ingredient to provide the tart flavor. A unique Andhra favorite among the 'gongura' lovers. The factor that makes this rice special is the tart flavor of roasted gongura flavor which melds beautifully with mustard, fenugreek and red chilli spices yielding a sensational one pot rice dish. A complete vegetarian meal along side a bowl of yogurt and papad. \r\n\r\nGongura Pulihora Recipe\r\nPrep & Cooking: 45-50 mts\r\nServes 4-5 persons\r\n","image":"http:\/\/www.sailusfood.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/08\/red-sorrel-leaves-rice.jpg","image-small":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/red-sorrel-leaves-rice-150x150.jpg","image-large":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/red-sorrel-leaves-rice-300x300.jpg","style":["easy","quick","modern"],"course":["main"],"special-diet":["eggless","nut free","vegetarian","vegan","dairy free","kid friendly","pregnancy"],"cuisine":["andhra"],"cook-time":"20","prep-time":"15","main-ingredient":["gongura","rice","red sorrel leaves"],"serves":"5","goes-well-with":["yogurt","papad"],"author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Andhra Recipes","Green Leafy Vegetables","Indian Rice recipes","Indian Vegan Recipes","Indian Vegetarian Recipes"],"tags":["gongura","pulihora","red-sorrel-leaves","rice"]}
