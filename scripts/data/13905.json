Hence fewer blog updates. I know a number of you dear readers are hoping for more frequent blog posts. I do not like to be away from my blog and its readers. Believe me. I am trying to balance my offline and online activities without neglecting either of them. I really wish there were more than 24 hours in a day. :) I hope to share more recipes in the coming months. \r\n\r\nFor today, I have for you a South Indian classic breakfast side dish, Tomato Kurma. Simply delectable with dosa. Judging by the ingredients, you would tell that the dish is going to be tasty but the preparation work would be a little daunting. But totally worth the effort for a weekend brunch or breakfast.\r\n\r\nTomato Kurma and Gun Powder with Dosa ~ Our weekend brunch","image":"http:\/\/www.sailusfood.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/05\/tomato-kurma.jpg","image-small":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/tomato-kurma-150x150.jpg","image-large":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/tomato-kurma-300x300.jpg","style":["easy","quick","modern"],"course":["main-course"],"special-diet":["eggless","dairy free","nut free","gluten free","vegetarian","vegan","kid friendly","pregnancy"],"cuisine":["south indian"],"cook-time":"30","prep-time":"10","main-ingredient":["tomato","coconut"],"serves":"4","goes-well-with":["dosa","appam"],"author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Indian Curry Recipes","Recipes Vegetable Dishes","South Indian Recipes"],"tags":["kurma","tomato","tomato-kurma"]}
