Mathris are savory flaky deep fried crackers made with flour, ghee, water and ajwain. The classic Indian snack is very popular namkeen in North Indian states especially Rajasthan and Punjab and is served with achaar (pickle) as a tea time snack. It is prepared for festivals like Diwali, Holi and Karwa Chauth. The mathri dough is flavored with an assortment of spices like anardana (dried pomegranate seeds), tymol seeds (ajwain), cumin (jeera), black pepper (kala mirch) and dried fenugreek leaves (kasuri methi). \r\n\r\nHow to make Mathri\r\n\r\nToday's Methi Mathri recipe is flavorful and when served with mirchi ka achar it is addictive. A must try Namkeen!\r\n","image":"http:\/\/www.sailusfood.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/methi-mathri-recipe.jpg","image-small":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/methi-mathri-recipe-150x150.jpg","image-large":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/methi-mathri-recipe-300x300.jpg","style":["easy","quick","modern"],"special-diet":["eggless","nut free","gluten","dairy","vegetarian","kid friendly","pregnancy"],"cuisine":["north indian"],"cook-time":"30","prep-time":"30","main-ingredient":["flour","kasuri methi"],"serves":"30","goes-well-with":["tea"],"author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Festival Foods","Flour Recipes","Indian Festivals","Indian Snacks and Starter Recipes","Indian Vegetarian Recipes","North Indian Recipes"],"tags":["mathri","snacks"]}
