Warm and comforting flavors, visually appealing, rich and sweet, carrot kheer lends a striking dash of orange to the table. A decadent dessert to finish off a festive thali (meal).\r\n\r\nRed carrots work best but you can use the orange ones too. I used the orange ones as I could not find the red carrots at my local farmer's market. Use of whole milk and sweetened condensed milk yields a rich kheer. \r\n\r\nCarrot Kheer\r\n\r\nCarrot Kheer Recipe\r\nCooking Time: 45 mts\r\nCuisine: North Indian\r\nServes 6-7 persons\r\n. \r\n\r\nIngredients:\r\n\r\n2 1\/4 cups low fat milk, boil till it reaches 1 1\/2 cups \r\n\r\n1 cup grated carrot\r\n\r\n4 tbsps sugar (adjust)\r\n\r\n1\/2 tsp cardamom pwd\r\n\r\npinch of saffron, mix with 2 tsps milk\r\n\r\n5-6 cashew nuts\/almonds, toasted in ghee\r\n\r\n10-12 raisins, toasted in ghee\r\n\r\n2 tbsps ghee\r\n\r\n1 Heat a vessel, add ghee and toast the cashew nuts and raisins till golden brown.
