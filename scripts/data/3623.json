And an integral part of every such meal is 'chaaru', the Andhra version of Tamil Nadu's 'rasam'. \r\n\r\nThe other day I made Mysore Rasam, a tamarind based Indian soup and served it along with bitter gourd stir fry and rice. The tempering of the spices and fresh curry leaves in ghee blend with the simmering tamarind and tur dal base filling the kitchen with a nutty, warming aroma that is simply irresistible. You'd want to eat your meal much before lunch-time. :)\r\n\r\nMysore Rasam Recipe\r\nPrep & Cooking: 30 mts\r\nServes 4-5 persons\r\nCuisine: South Indian\r\n.\r\n\r\nIngredients:\r\n\r\n1\/2 cup cooked and mashed tur dal\r\n\r\nsmall lemon sized tamarind, soak in 3 cups warm water \r\n\r\nsmall tomato, chopped\r\n\r\npinch of turmeric\r\n\r\nsalt to taste\r\n\r\ncoriander leaves for garnish\r\n\r\nRoast and pwd:\r\n\r\n1 tbsp tur dal\r\n\r\n1\/2 tbsp pepper (adjust)\r\n\r\n1\/4 tsp methi seeds\r\n\r\n1\/4 tbsp cumin seeds\r\n\r\n3\/4 tbsp coriander seeds\r\n\r\n3-4 dry red chillis\r\n\r\n1\/2 tbsp coconut (optional)\r\n\r\nFor tempering\/tadka\/poppu:\r\n\r\n1 tsp ghee\r\n\r\n1\/2 tsp mustard seeds\r\n\r\n3\/4 tsp cumin seeds\r\n\r\n10-12 fresh curry leaves\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Heat a tsp of oil in a pan, add the ingredients called for rasam pwd except grated coconut, roast on low to medium flame for 3 mts.
