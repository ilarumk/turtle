Satish relishes a hotel style coconut chutney recipe that I prepare. Its only recently that I chanced upon this recipe thanks to my aunt who made it on a visit to her home. I am not sure of its origins but this recipe is a WINNER and am sure you are going to love it. \r\n\r\nThe key is use fresh coconut gratings and not to go over board with the spices. Subtly spiced and tempering with curry leaves gives the coconut chutney all the charm it needs to be your favorite side with dosa and idli.","image":"http:\/\/www.sailusfood.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/05\/hotel-coconut-chutney.jpg","image-small":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/hotel-coconut-chutney-150x150.jpg","image-large":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/hotel-coconut-chutney-300x300.jpg","style":["easy","quick","modern"],"course":["chutney"],"special-diet":["eggless","dairy free","nut free","gluten free","vegetarian","kid friendly","pregnancy"],"cuisine":["south indian"],"cook-time":"1","prep-time":"10","main-ingredient":["coconut"],"serves":"4","goes-well-with":["idli","dosa","vada"],"author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Andhra Recipes","Indian Chutney Recipes - Pachadi","Indian Vegan Recipes","Indian Vegetarian Recipes","South Indian Recipes"],"tags":["chutney","coconut-chutney","pachadi"]}
