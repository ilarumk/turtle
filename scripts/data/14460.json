Last week, Nehal had a long unexpected break from school due to the bandh and breakfast was served pretty late in the mornings. Well, we had late nights and lazy mornings. :)\r\n\r\nEvery now and then, I try to make a special paneer dish to go with rotis, away from the routine palak paneer or paneer butter masala. The possibilities with paneer are endless and I always look forward to try new and exciting flavors. Paneer Tawa Masala, is a simple, easy to put together special dish. It is a combination of sweet and tangy flavors with a creamy textured sauce. Serve this restaurant style vegetarian delight with phulka or naan.","image":"http:\/\/www.sailusfood.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/paneer-tawa-masala-recipe.jpg","image-small":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/paneer-tawa-masala-recipe-150x150.jpg","image-large":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/paneer-tawa-masala-recipe-300x300.jpg","style":["easy","quick","modern"],"course":["main-course"],"special-diet":["eggless","nut free","dairy","gluten free","vegetarian","kid friendly","pregnancy"],"cuisine":["indian"],"cook-time":"30","prep-time":"15","main-ingredient":["paneer"],"serves":"5","goes-well-with":["naan"],"author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Indian Curry Recipes","Indian Paneer Recipes","Indian Vegetarian Recipes","North Indian Recipes"],"tags":["paneer","paneer-recipes"]}
