She is a prolific food blogger who regularly updates her blog with simple everyday recipes with a focus on Konkani food. I admire Shilpa for her dedication to bring Konkani recipes on the world food map and has even got her Aayi (mother) to blog about food. \r\n\r\nI asked Shilpa to write an article on traditional Konkani food and she readily accepted to do one. In today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s essay on Konkani cuisine, she enriches our culinary knowledge with two traditional recipes of North Canara region of Karnataka and also gives us a glimpse of traditional thalis of Konkan region. There is no denying that authentic recipes are often diluted with changing tastes and preferences. Hope our humble attempt will motivate our younger generation, especially those living away from home, to appreciate, learn and cook our traditional foods. And let's hope our traditional cuisines survive for our future generations. \r\n\r\nThank you, Shilpa, for taking time to write a wonderful article on your home cuisine. Friends, please welcome Shilpa. :)\r\n\r\n~ Sailaja\r\n\r\nAn Essay on Konkan Cuisine \r\n\r\nKonkan region is the beautiful thin strip on the west coast of India. Along with the state languages spoken, Konkani is one of the widely spoken languages. There are many different dialects of Konkani, which is usually a mix of Konkani words plus the other languages. There are a lot of unique words in each dialects. \r\n\r\nMy family is from North Kanara. So this post will mostly focus on the North Kanara Konkani food. Like all other communities in India, for food, Konkanis mostly rely on, what is grown in their backyards. So a typical Konkani home in North Kanara would have a big yard dominated by coconut trees - that is the reason coconut is a primary ingredient in the food. These days all other vegetables are readily available in markets, but still lot of people rely mainly on coconut based food. Coconut oil is mainly used in almost all dishes. Over the past decade, people are getting more and more health conscious and moving away from coconut consumption, but still it's maintaining it's lead I believe. \r\n\r\nAlong with coconut, the other trees\/plants you could find easily here are - \r\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2\tTeppal which is an important and niche spice. This is used both in vegetarian and non vegetarian dishes alike. Ask anyone from this place and you would definitely hear - tappla ambat (a coconut gravy with teppal). \r\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2\t","image":"http:\/\/www.sailusfood.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/10\/konkani-veg-thali-1.jpg","image-small":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/konkani-veg-thali-1-150x150.jpg","image-large":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/konkani-veg-thali-1-300x300.jpg","main-ingredient":["snake gourd"],"author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Indian Vegetarian Recipes","Recipes Vegetable Dishes"],"tags":["konkani_recipes"]}
