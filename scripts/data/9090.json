Slowly add few tbsps of milk, little at a time, to form a pliable dough (like chapati dough). Keep aside. In another bowl, add 1\/4 cup dessicated coconut pwd, 1\/2 cup powdered sugar, few drops of vanilla essence or pinch of cardamom pwd and mix well. Add 1 1\/2 tbsps of melted butter and mix well to form a sticky textured mixture.\r\n\r\nRoll the biscuit cocoa dough into an elongated shaped roti (thicker than a chapati). Spread the coconut-sugar mixture all over. Slowly roll the biscuit-cocoa roti to form a roll. Seal the ends and if the dough tends to break in between, lightly press to enclose and continue rolling. Wrap in an aluminum foil and set in fridge for 2 hrs. After its set, remove the foil and slice with a knife into 1\/2\" thickness pieces and serve.","image":"http:\/\/www.sailusfood.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/05\/marie-biscuit-chocolate-roll.jpg","image-small":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/marie-biscuit-chocolate-roll-150x150.jpg","image-large":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/marie-biscuit-chocolate-roll-300x300.jpg","style":["easy","modern","quick"],"course":["dessert"],"special-diet":["eggless","nut free","vegetarian","dairy","kid friendly","pregnancy"],"cuisine":["indian"],"cook-time":"0","prep-time":"20","main-ingredient":["marie biscuit","cocoa","dessicated coconut"],"serves":"7","goes-well-with":["smoothie"],"author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Eggless Dessert Recipes","Indian Vegetarian Recipes","Sweet Dessert Recipes"],"tags":["chocolate","dessert","eggless","marie-biscuits","rolls"]}
