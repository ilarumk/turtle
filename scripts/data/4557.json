It has never let me down and its my favorite ever since I chanced upon Hemantji's sambar podi. The key to a good aromatic sambar is 'sambar powder' and the vegetables that go into its making. \r\n\r\nThere are numerous versions of sambar but this one is note worthy due to the magical sambar powder. Not only is sambar protein rich but also loaded with nutritional goodness. Tasty with earthy, sweet-tangy flavors and laced with an aromatic whiff of asafoetida and fresh curry leaves. Absolute divine taste. :) \r\n\r\n Homemade Sambar Powder \r\n\r\n\r\nSambar Recipe\r\nPrep & Cooking: 45 mts\r\nServes 4-5 persons\r\nCuisine: South Indian \r\n. \r\n\r\nIngredients: \r\n\r\n1 cup tur dal \r\n\r\n3-4 cups of cubed bottlegourd \r\n\r\n10-12 small sambar onions (or shallots) \r\n\r\n2 medium tomatoes quartered\r\n\r\npinch of turmeric \r\n\r\n1 large lemon sized tamarind (extract the juice in 1 cup water) \r\n\r\n1 tbsp jaggery or sugar (optional) \r\n\r\n1 1\/2 tbsps sambar powder \r\n\r\nsalt to taste \r\n\r\ncoriander leaves for garnish\r\n\r\nFor tempering\/poppu\/tadka: \r\n\r\n1\/2 tbsp oil\/ghee \r\n\r\n3\/4 tsp mustard seeds \r\n\r\n1\/4 tsp asafoetida\/hing\/inguva or 3-4 crushed garlic flakes \r\n\r\n2 dry red chilli (tear and de-seed) \r\n\r\n10-12 fresh curry leaves \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n1 Pressure cook dal with 2 cups of water and a pinch of hing.
