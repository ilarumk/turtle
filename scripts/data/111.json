Few of the marinated paneer pieces were still sitting in my refrigerator and the sudden announcement of an arrival of a guest, I knew it was time for another barbeque...:). \r\n\r\nPaneer kebabs are marinated paneer pieces grilled or barbecued in a traditional tandoor along with onions, tomatoes and capsicums(bell peppers). Away from the monotony, I tried my hand at 3 different marinades, each imparting a different color and taste to the paneer. The subtlety and balance of the flavors, infused in the paneer pieces along with crunchy vegetables makes paneer kebabs, a delicious appetizer\/starter.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTri-Colored Paneer Kebabs Recipe\r\n\r\nIngredients:\r\nYellow Colored Paneer Kebabs\r\n\r\n8-10 paneer pieces (cut into a 2\" squares)\r\n4-5 tbsps hung curds\r\n1 tsp black pepper pwd (you can use a pinch of garam masala pwd also for added flavaor)\r\n1 tsp amchur pwd or lemon juice\r\nbig pinch turmeric pwd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c(give yellow color to the paneer)\r\nsalt to taste\r\n\r\nMarinate the paneer pieces in the above marinade for 2 hours in the refrigerator.\r\n\r\nRed Colored Paneer Kebabs\r\n\r\n8-10 paneer pieces (cut into a 2\" squares)\r\n1 tsp red chilli pwd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c (gives red color to the paneer)\r\n1 tsp ginger garlic paste\r\n1\/2 tsp kasoori methi (optional)\r\n4-5 tbsp hung curds\r\n1 tbsp lemon juice\r\nsalt to taste\r\n\r\nMarinate the paneer pieces in above marinade for 2 hours in the refrigerator.\r\n\r\nGreen Colored Paneer Kebabs\r\n\r\n8-10 paneer pieces (cut into a 2\" squares)\r\nMake a paste of mint (small cup) and coriander leaves(small cup),1 green chilli,1\"ginger piece,1 tbsp lemon juice and salt. Marinate the paneer in this paste for 2 hours in the refrigerator. This marinade gives a green shade to the paneer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMake thick slices of 3 medium onions and 3 medium sized tomatoes and cut 2 capsicums into big pieces and keep aside.You can marinate the pieces with any of the above marinades. I usually toss them in a dressing of lemon juice and chilli pwd or pepper pwd and skewer them along with the marinated paneer pieces.\r\n\r\nI used my traditional earthen stove or home tandoor called 'kumpati' (with charcoal) to grill\/barbaque the paneer. I did not brush the paneer with oil before grilling. So absolutely no fat was using in the cooking process. Skewer the vegetables and paneer pieces and grill them for 5-6 minutes turning them around while its cooking to ensure they don't burn and cook them till they are soft and attain a light golden shade. Serve with green chutney or tomato ketchup.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn absolutely delicious,melt-in-the mouth,low-carb,healthy appetizer or starter with refreshingly crunchy vegetables!\r\n\r\n","image":"http:\/\/www.sailusfood.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/paneer_kebabs.JPG","image-small":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/paneer_kebabs-150x150.jpg","image-large":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/paneer_kebabs-300x300.jpg","main-ingredient":["paneer"],"author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Indian Milk Recipes","Indian Paneer Recipes","Indian Snacks and Starter Recipes","Indian Vegetarian Recipes","North Indian Recipes"]}
