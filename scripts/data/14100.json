And its also important that I include nutrient-rich vegetables to make it healthy. Its been pouring cats and dogs the past few days with no sign of any sunshine. On one such cold and rainy morning, I prepared Oats Masala which is close to Oats Upma recipe that I blogged earlier. \r\n\r\nOats Masala basically is nothing but inclusion of oats in Masala Upma recipe. I reduced the amount of semolina and included dry roasted instant oats, mixed vegetables and a generous amount of ghee. Oats and garam masala go well with each other and when they come together in the form of an upma it exudes warmth and spice. Be sure to serve Oats Masala warm and garnished with fresh coriander. I like to eat this oats recipe with home made tomato pickle.\r\n\r\nOats Masala","image":"http:\/\/www.sailusfood.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/11\/oats-masala.jpg","image-small":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/oats-masala-150x150.jpg","image-large":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/oats-masala-300x300.jpg","style":["easy","quick","modern"],"course":["breakfast"],"special-diet":["eggless","dairy free","nut free","gluten free","vegetarian","vegan","kid friendly","pregnancy"],"cuisine":["Andhra"],"cook-time":"30","prep-time":"10","main-ingredient":["oats","vegetables"],"serves":"3","goes-well-with":["pickle","yogurt"],"author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Andhra Recipes","Indian Breakfast Recipes","Indian Vegan Recipes","Indian Vegetarian Recipes","Recipes Vegetable Dishes"],"tags":["indian-recipes-with-oats","oats","oats-masala"]}
