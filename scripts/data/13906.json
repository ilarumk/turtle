Chutney aka Pachadi is a revered dish in our home and my blog is testimony to it. Chutney recipes are numerous with various permutations and combinations. I do not follow any particular chutney recipe as such when I venture out to make a pachadi. I just add a twist to an original chutney recipe by tweaking it and a new chutney flavor is born. \r\n\r\nI wanted to make an authentic Chettinad tomato chutney to go with idli for breakfast and went about searching through my large collection of hand written recipes for one. I found a couple of chettinad chutney recipes but was not sure how authentic they were but settled for this particular chutney recipe as I liked the list of ingredients that went into its making. I'm glad I made it. Its the coconut milk which elevates the flavor of the tomato chutney. Spicy with slight tang and sweet notes, Chettinad tomato chutney is sensational and a keeper.\r\n\r\nTomato Chutney with Idli","image":"http:\/\/www.sailusfood.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/05\/chettinad-tomato-chutney.jpg","image-small":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/chettinad-tomato-chutney-150x150.jpg","image-large":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/chettinad-tomato-chutney-300x300.jpg","style":["easy","quick","modern"],"course":["side"],"special-diet":["eggless","dairy free","nut free","gluten free","vegetarian","kid friendly","pregnancy"],"cuisine":["chettinad"],"cook-time":"15","prep-time":"5","main-ingredient":["tomato"],"serves":"4","goes-well-with":["idli","dosa"],"author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Indian Chutney Recipes - Pachadi","Indian Vegan Recipes","Recipes Vegetable Dishes"],"tags":["chettinad-recipes","tomato","tomato-chutney"]}
