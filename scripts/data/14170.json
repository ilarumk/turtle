At home, we love our potatoes and cannot do without them. The other day, a blogger friend, Nandita of Saffron Trail, posted a fantastic Masala Aloo recipe. This quick simple recipe is from Sanjeev Kapoor's cooking show, Khana Khazana. I tried it this morning for our mid day meal and am absolutely floored. Potato Roast couldn't have got any better. Soul food at its best!\r\n\r\nPotato Roast\r\n\r\nBoiled and peeled potato cubes are tossed and roasted in aromatic Indian spices till a crispy crust is formed and garnished with coriander leaves. The key ingredient is rice flour which lends a crisp crust to the potatoes. Do use rice flour or corn meal (if you do not have rice flour on hand). I served the Potato Roast with steamed rice and Pappu pulusu (tangy vegetable stew) and papad.","image":"http:\/\/www.sailusfood.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/12\/potato-roast.jpg","image-small":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/potato-roast-150x150.jpg","image-large":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/potato-roast-300x300.jpg","style":["easy","quick","modern"],"course":["side"],"special-diet":["eggless","dairy free","nut free","gluten free","vegetarian","vegan","kid friendly","pregnancy"],"cuisine":["north indian"],"cook-time":"12","prep-time":"15","main-ingredient":["potato"],"serves":"4","goes-well-with":["rice","dal"],"author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Indian Fry Recipes","Indian Vegan Recipes","Indian Vegetarian Recipes","North Indian Recipes","Recipes Vegetable Dishes"],"tags":["aloo","potato","potato-roast"]}
