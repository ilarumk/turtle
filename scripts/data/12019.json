And its a must buy vegetable on each visit to the Rythu Bazaar (Farmer's Market).\r\n\r\nOne of the best vegetarian recipe I have had in a long time is a stuffed okra with its origins in Gujarat. Tarla Dalal's recipe for a Gujarati stuffed bhindi is simply out of the world. I am not exaggerating. Those who hate okra will definitely fall in love with it when they try Bhindi Sambhariya.\r\n\r\nBhindi Sambhariya\r\n\r\nBe sure to use tender okra and add enough stuffing in each okra. Its all the in the stuffing. The combination of ingredients that go into the stuffing are extremely flavorful hence do not skimp of the quantity of stuffing used for each okra.\r\n\r\nBhindi with stuffing ready to be stir fried\r\n\r\nBhindi Sambhariya Recipe\r\nPrep & Cooking: 45-50 mts\r\nServes: 4\r\nCuisine: Gujarati\r\nSource: Adapted from Tarla Dalal Cookbook\r\n.\r\n\r\nIngredients:\r\n\r\n1\/4 kg tender okra\/bhindi\/bendakayalu\r\n\r\n1 tbsp oil\r\n\r\n1\/4 tsp hing\/asafoetida\/inguva\r\n\r\nfew curry leaves (optional)\r\n\r\nFor stuffing:\r\n\r\n1 1\/2 tsps ginger green chili paste\r\n\r\n1\/2 tbsp roasted coriander pwd\r\n\r\n1 tsp roasted cumin powder\r\n\r\npinch garam masala powder\r\n\r\n1\/2 tbsp white sesame seeds\r\n\r\n3-4 tbsps fresh coriander leaves, finely chopped\r\n\r\n3 tbsps fresh coconut, grated \r\n\r\n2 tsps brown sugar or jaggery or white sugar\r\n\r\n2 tbsps coarsely powdered peanuts\r\n\r\n1\/2 tbsp oil\r\n\r\nsalt to taste\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Mix all the ingredients meant for stuffing in a bowl.

Stuff all the bhindi and keep aside\r\n3 Heat oil in a vessel. Once hot, add asafoetida and curry leaves and saute for few seconds. Add the stuffed okra and spread them around the vessel in a single layer. Add any left over stuffing and cook on low medium flame without lid. Every few minutes turn the okra to allow even cooking on all sides. Slow roasting of the okra can take at least 30 minutes.\r\n4 Turn off heat. Serve with rice or roti.","image":"http:\/\/www.sailusfood.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/08\/stuffed-ladys-finger.jpg","image-small":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/stuffed-ladys-finger-150x150.jpg","image-large":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/stuffed-ladys-finger-300x300.jpg","course":["main"],"special-diet":["eggless","dairy free","gluten free","vegan","vegetarian","kid friendly","pregnancy"],"cuisine":["gujarati"],"cook-time":"35","prep-time":"15","main-ingredient":["bhindi","peanuts","coconut","coriander leaves"],"serves":"4","goes-well-with":["rice","roti"],"author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Gujarati Recipes","Indian Fry Recipes","Indian Vegan Recipes","Indian Vegetarian Recipes","Recipes Vegetable Dishes"],"tags":["bhindi","bhindi-sambhariya","okra","stir-fry"]}
