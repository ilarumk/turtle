This flat bread which is stuffed with sweetened lentil mixture is popular in other parts of the country and goes by the name Puran poli, Holige, Obbattu, Paruppu poli, Vedhmi and Puranachi poli. Much loved among those with a sweet tooth.\r\n\r\nMoong dal, maida dough, cooked and sweetened moong dal\r\n\r\nStep by step bobbatlu preparation\r\n\r\nUsually the choice of dal for the stuffing is Bengal gram aka chana dal in our state of Andhra. For a change I have made pesarapappu bobbatlu which has yellow moong dal instead of chana dal. Your choice of sweetner can be jaggery though I used sugar since I ran out of jaggery. You can even use tur dal in place of moong or chana dal.\r\n\r\nPesarapappu bobbatlu","image":"http:\/\/www.sailusfood.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/01\/bobbatlu-pindi-vantalu.jpg","image-small":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/bobbatlu-pindi-vantalu-150x150.jpg","image-large":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/bobbatlu-pindi-vantalu-300x300.jpg","style":["easy","traditional"],"course":["dessert"],"special-diet":["eggless","nut free","gluten","dairy","vegetarian","kid friendly","pregnancy"],"cuisine":["andhra"],"cook-time":"30","prep-time":"30","main-ingredient":["moong dal","maida"],"serves":"15","goes-well-with":["ghee"],"author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Andhra Recipes","Festival Foods","Indian Festivals","Indian Sweets Recipes","Navratri Recipes"],"tags":["andhra-recipes","festival_sweets","moong dal"]}
