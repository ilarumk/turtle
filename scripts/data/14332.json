I cannot emphasis enough the nutritional value of Ragi and it makes sense to include this humble grain (finger millet) in our daily diet. There are many Indian recipes using ragi flour include Ragi dosa, Ragi Malt, Ragi Roti and Ragi Mudde to name a few. In rural India, this poor man's grain is extensively cultivated and consumed by the rural folks because of its nutritional value (high protein with low glycemic index) and affordability. \r\n\r\nToday's Ragi Idli recipe is a tasty alternative to the traditional South Indian breakfast, Idli. A healthy Indian breakfast that is full of fiber, low carb, filling and tasty. Could you ask for more? :) \r\n\r\nHealthy Indian breakfast dish prepared using Ragi flour","image":"http:\/\/www.sailusfood.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/03\/ragi-idli.jpg","image-small":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/ragi-idli-150x150.jpg","image-large":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/ragi-idli-300x300.jpg","style":["easy","modern"],"course":["breakfast"],"special-diet":["eggless","dairy free","gluten free","vegetarian","vegan","kid friendly","pregnancy"],"cuisine":["south indian"],"cook-time":"15","prep-time":"15","main-ingredient":["ragi"],"serves":"5","goes-well-with":["chutney","sambar"],"author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Indian Breakfast Recipes","Indian Vegan Recipes","Indian Vegetarian Recipes","South Indian Recipes"],"tags":["ragi","ragi-idli"]}
