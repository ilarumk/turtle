I reminse the good olden days of sharing some great moments with tatayya over a glass of chikkati majjiga (thick buttermilk). I grew up drinking \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmajjiga\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and it still is a routine affair in our home, call it a mix of tradition, habit, nutrition and comfort. Visit any Andhra home during summer time and you are sure to be welcomed with a chilled glass of majjiga (moru - Tamil), majjige (Kannada), chaas(Gujarati), lassi (punjabi)).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMajjiga is an integral part of Andhra cuisine and no meal is complete without Majjiga which is usually taken towards the end of a meal as it has the ability to enhance digestion. Majjiga which is known by different names in the West like Salted Yogurt Drink, Yogurt Shake and Indian Drinking Yogurt is a blend of three tastes which are sweet, sour and astringent. Majjiga is one of the easiest recipes even a 6 year old can whip up and is nothing but a blend of fresh curds, plain water and salt. Replace the salt with sugar and it becomes Sweet Lassi, a very popular sweet drink beverage in North India, having its origins in Punjab. The best way to prepare \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmajjiga\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 is to always use fresh home made curds and mix it in equal parts of water to make a thick buttermilk (chikkati majjiga). For a more thinner majjiga add 3 parts of water to one part of curds and use a hand churner or kavvam (traditional wooden or stainless steel churner) to churn the mixture, rolling it back and forth between your palms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDo this for 2 minutes.This action helps in blending the mixture well and any fat which is in the curd will separate and rise to the top. Skim off the fat. (If you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a hand churner similar to the ones shown in the picture, use a blender to blend on low speed for a minute).\r\n\r\nAndhra Spiced Buttermilk is a soothing combination of fresh home made curds, water, fresh curry leaves, crushed ginger, green chillis, salt and a dash of lemon juice. This spice and herb infused drink is a perfect blend of myriad flavors - sweet, spicy, sour and salty which balances and pacifies all the three doshas - Vata, Pitta and Kapha, strengthens and increases our appetite and digestive power.\r\n\r\nAndhra Spiced Buttermilk\r\n\r\nIngredients:\r\n4 glasses of buttermilk(made from 4 parts water and 1 part curds)\r\n1-2 green chillies finely chopped (adjust according to your choice)\r\n\u00c2\u00bd\u00e2\u20ac\u009d ginger piece grated or crushed\r\nfew curry leaves (only fresh leaves)\r\n1-2 tbsp lemon juice\r\nsalt to taste\r\ncoriander leaves(optional)\r\nMix all the above ingredients and chill.Serve cold.\r\n\r\nAnother variation is to add a tempering of mustard seeds and curry leaves to the above prepared majjiga. Heat \u00c2\u00bd tsp of oil in a pan and add 1\/2 tsp of mustard seeds and let them splutter. Add the curry leaves and let the flavors blend in the oil, remove from heat and immediately add to the majjiga and cover for a few minutes and then blend with a churner for a minute and chill. Serve cold.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother version is nimmakaaya majjiga or nimma majjiga which is plain salted majjiga (blend of curds and water) with a dash of lemon juice.\r\nNorth Indian version of buttermilk or lassi calls for the use of rock salt, dry roasted cumin pwd and fresh mint leaves.Read more about Lassi.\r\n\r\nEach home has its own version of buttermilk be it North, South, East or West.The basic recipe of buttermilk is the same, only the infusion of spices and herbs differs according to each home or region. Read more about curds or yogurt and home made yogurt.\r\n\r\nButtermilk is highly recommended as one the best home remedies for certain ailments like piles, diarrhoea,  jaundice and dysfunctions of liver and spleen.Read more about the  benefits of  buttermilk. This traditional thrist-quenching refreshing drink with high therapeutic and nutritional properties is appetizing, cooling, rejunuvating, soothing and serves as an excellent antidote to sunstrokes during Indian peak summer times. It tones the small intenstine, very light on the stomach and easy to digest unlike other dairy products like cheese and paneer. It goes without saying that majjiga is the healthiest low calorie milk product among the many dairy products and works as a good calcium substitute for the high calorie dairy products.\r\n\r\nButtermilk serves as a good home remedy for removing sun tan. Apply buttermilk to the face and rinse off with cool water, once dry. Do this regularly and your tan disappears and your face gets back it lost glow. So it works as a beauty enhancer too\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6:)\r\n\r\nI had to start with my series on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Indian Drinks & Sharbats\u00e2\u20ac\u009d with this heavenly traditional drink which most of us in Andhra cannot do without.
