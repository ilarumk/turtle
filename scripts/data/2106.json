It also goes very well with pulagam or kandi pachadi and rice. I love this recipe for its utter simplicity and not to mention, its completely addictive!\r\n\r\nVankaya Pachi Pulusu\r\n\r\nMashed roasted white brinjals are combined with raw tamarind, jaggery, chopped onions, green chillis and spices to impart an aromatic stew, Vankaya pachi pulusu. The sweetness of jaggery balances out the tangy flavor of tamarind and the spice of green chillis while the addition of curry leaves along with tempering intensifies the flavor. Biting into crunchy raw onions and savoring the sweet-tangy smoky flavor of this earthy colored pulusu with rice, is heaven on earth.\r\n\r\nVankaya Pachi Pulusu Recipe\r\nRecipe source: Amma\r\nPrep & Cooking: 20-25 mts\r\nServes 3-4 persons\r\nCuisine: Andhra\r\n.\r\n\r\nIngredients:\r\n\r\n1 very large brinjal (preferably white or else purple)\r\n\r\n1 onion, finely chopped\r\n\r\nsmall lemon sized tamarind (soak in a cup of warm water for 10-12 mts, extract thick pulp)\r\n\r\n1-2 green chillies, finely chopped\r\n\r\n1 1\/2 tbsp grated jaggery (adjust)\r\n\r\n1 tbsp finely chopped coriander leaves \r\n\r\n1 1\/2 cups water \r\n\r\nsalt to taste\r\n\r\nPoppu\/Tadka\/Tempering: \r\n\r\n1-2 dry red chillis, tear and de-seed\r\n\r\n1\/2 tsp mustard seeds\r\n\r\n1\/2 tsp cumin seeds\r\n\r\n1\/2 tsp split gram dal\/urad dal\/minappa pappu (optional)\r\n\r\n1\/4 tsp asafoetida\/hing\/inguva or 2-3 crushed garlic flakes\r\n\r\n10-12 fresh curry leaves\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Grease the brinjal with oil and roast over low heat.
