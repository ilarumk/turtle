But chukkakura pachadi also evokes the same emotion just by the thought of its preparation. Both pachadis are pretty much similar in flavor - tangy and spicy. Chukka kura (khatta palak\/ambat chukka) is a sour leafy green available in our parts with fleshy leaves similar in looks to spinach and a flavor as tangy as red sorrel or gongura leaves. A common preparation in Andhra households is to cook it with tur dal, Chukka Koora Pappu and sometimes as a pachadi. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis vibrant green colored pachadi is so good that you could eat it even without the seasoning.  But I feel a pachadi is incomplete without the tempering though sometimes it could overshadow the flavor of the main ingredients. I know of friends who feel that most pachadis really don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need any kind of embellishments and taste good even without the customary tempering. But tempering is a very important and integral part of our Indian cooking and you can read more about its significance here.\r\n\r\nWith a garlicy flavor, a good balance of tart and spice, freckled with a colorful spice tempering and curry leaves, chukkakura pachadi can be savored with hot rice, a generous helping of melted ghee and chopped raw onions. Serve your family and friends, as an elegant accompaniment to a festive meal and you are sure to hear murmurs of pleasure.\r\n\r\n\r\nChukkakura Pachadi Recipe\r\nPrep & Cooking: 15 mts\r\nServes 3-4 persons\r\nCuisine: Andhra\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\nIngredients:\r\n\r\n3 big bunches chukka kura (greens), washed and chopped fine\r\n\r\n3-4 green chillis (adjust)\r\n\r\n2 tsps cumin seeds\r\n\r\n3-4 garlic cloves\r\n\r\nFor seasoning\/poppu\/tadka:\r\n\r\n1\/2 tsp mustard seeds\r\n\r\n1\/2 tsp cumin seeds (optional)\r\n\r\n1 tsp split black gram dal (urad dal\/minapappu)\r\n\r\n1 tsp channa dal (senaga pappu)- optional\r\n\r\n1-2 dry red chillis\r\n\r\nfew fresh curry leaves\r\n\r\n1 tsp oil\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Heat one tsp oil in a pan, add green chillis and fry on medium heat for 3-4 mts.
