In my home, they take the form of Upma as a quick tiffin on a busy day, Fries as a tea time snack and Manchurian as a starter to serve friends on a rain filled day. \r\n\r\nThis unusual yet unique fusion food that takes an Indo Chinese avatar is soft on the inside with a crisp exterior. Tossed in sauces and combined with bell peppers, the end result makes it hard to identify that the main ingredient is our humble Idli. \r\n\r\nIdli Manchurian Recipe\r\nPrep & Cooking Time: 30 mts\r\nServes 4-5 persons\r\nCuisine: Indo-Chinese\r\n.\r\n\r\nIngredients:\r\n\r\n6-8 left over idlis, cut each into 8-9 pieces\r\n\r\n2 tbsps maida\/all-purpose flour\r\n\r\n1 tbsp cornflour\r\n\r\n1 tsp ginger-garlic-green chilli paste\r\n\r\na little less than 1\/2 cup warm water \r\n\r\nsalt to taste\r\n\r\nFor sauce:\r\n \r\n1\/4 cup spring onions, finely chopped\r\n\r\n1\/2 capsicum, finely sliced\r\n\r\n1 tbsp finely minced garlic\r\n\r\n1\/4 tsp finely minced ginger\r\n\r\n1-2 finely chopped green chillis\r\n\r\n1\/4 tsp red chilli pwd (preferably Kashmiri)\r\n\r\n1\/2 tsp soya sauce\r\n\r\n1\/4 tbsp chilli sauce\r\n\r\n1 tsp vinegar\r\n\r\n1 1\/2 tbsps tomato sauce\r\n\r\n1\/2 tsp brown sugar (optional)\r\n\r\nsalt as required\r\n\r\n1 1\/2 tbsps sesame oil\r\n\r\n1 tbsp finely chopped coriander leaves OR finely chopped spring onion greens\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Heat oil for deep frying in a heavy bottomed vessel. \r\n2 In a bowl, combine maida, cornflour, salt, ginger-garlic-green chilli paste and water to make a thick paste.
