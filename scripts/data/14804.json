It is made in most parts of India and goes by different names like Ghugra, Karanji (Maharashtra), Pedakiya (Bihar) and Nevries (Goa). Gujiya is what we Andhras call Kajikayalu, the recipe of which I have blogged earlier. Both Gujiya and Kajikayalu follow the same recipe and procedure. The filling for Gujiya and Kajikayalu is a mixture of roasted dry coconut, nuts, khoya or sooji (semolina), cardamom powder and powdered sugar. \r\n\r\nGujiya is not an overly sweet dish. It has a crispy, flaky exterior with a cardamom flavored sweet filling. Today, am blogging Mawa Gujiya where unsweetened khoya is used in place of sooji (semolina). It can be stored at room temperature upto two weeks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGujiya Recipe ~ Step by Step\r\n\r\nSo, now that you have the recipe of Gujiya on hand, are you going try it this Holi? :)","image":"http:\/\/www.sailusfood.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/recipe-of-gujiya.jpg","image-small":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/recipe-of-gujiya-150x150.jpg","image-large":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/recipe-of-gujiya-300x300.jpg","style":["easy","traditional"],"course":["dessert"],"special-diet":["eggless","nuts","gluten","dairy","vegetarian","kid friendly","pregnancy"],"cuisine":["north indian"],"cook-time":"20","prep-time":"45","main-ingredient":["flour","mawa","coconut"],"serves":"20","author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Eggless Dessert Recipes","Festival Foods","Flour Recipes","Indian Festivals","Indian Sweets Recipes","North Indian Recipes","Sweet Dessert Recipes"],"tags":["festival_sweets","gujiya","sweets"]}
