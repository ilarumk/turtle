Today's Carrot Idli features colorful grated carrot along side a spiced herb-y mix of green chilies, coriander leaves and cumin. Apart from providing nutrition Carrot Idli is packed with flavor and visual appeal. You can either used fresh coriander or fresh mint, depending on what you have on hand. I personally like the subtle flavor of fresh coriander.\r\n\r\nDunk the idlis in warm sambar right before serving and you have a delicious bowl of comforting food on a cold winter morning. :) I served the Idli with a fiery ginger chutney, radish sambar (prepared the earlier day as a side for sponge dosa) and coconut chutney.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCarrot Idli with Radish Sambar, Coconut Chutney and Ginger Chutney","image":"http:\/\/www.sailusfood.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/11\/carrot-idli-breakfast-tiffin.jpg","image-small":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/carrot-idli-breakfast-tiffin-150x150.jpg","image-large":"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/turtle-sailusfood\/carrot-idli-breakfast-tiffin-300x300.jpg","style":["easy","quick","modern"],"course":["breakfast"],"special-diet":["eggless","dairy free","nut free","gluten free","vegetarian","vegan","kid friendly","pregnancy"],"cuisine":["south indian"],"cook-time":"12","prep-time":"15","main-ingredient":["urad dal","carrot"],"serves":"5","goes-well-with":["sambar","chutney"],"author":null,"type":"post","categories":["All Recipes","Indian Breakfast Recipes","Indian Vegan Recipes","Indian Vegetarian Recipes","Lunch Box Recipes","Recipes Vegetable Dishes","South Indian Recipes"],"tags":["breakfast","carrot-idli","idli","tiffin"]}
