It is a flaky, puffy, round shaped, golden colored sweetmeat that is popularly known as Badusha in the South and Balushahi in the North. Small balls that are slightly flattened are shaped out of a dough consisting of flour (maida), ghee and curd, deep fried to a golden shade and dunked in a warm sugar syrup. This classic Indian sweet has an amazing texture with a crisp outer layer and a soft, juicy interior.\r\n\r\nBadhusha\r\n\r\nIt might be intimidating for a beginner wanting to make this Indian sweet. Badusha recipe is not as difficult as one thinks it is. There are certain crucial steps to be followed while making them and if you follow them to the 'T', you will be successful. Making depressions in the rolled out balls, cooking them over slow flame and preparing the sugar syrup to the right consistency are the three most important steps that need to be taken care of while preparing Badusha.\r\n\r\nBalushahi\r\n\r\nFor all the new readers of Sailu's Kitchen, I am offering a FREE Ebook, 'The Best of Sailu's Kitchen' that has 27 all time popular recipes with photos.
